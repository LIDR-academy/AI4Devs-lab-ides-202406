# Ticket: Develop Backend for Processing Candidate Data

## Description
Implement the backend functionality to process and store the candidate information submitted through the "Add Candidate" form in the ATS system.

## Objectives
1. Create API endpoints to receive candidate data from the frontend
2. Implement data validation and sanitization on the server-side
3. Store candidate information in the database
4. Handle file uploads for candidate CVs
5. Implement error handling and logging

## Requirements
1. Create a RESTful API endpoint for receiving candidate data
2. Implement server-side validation for all incoming data
3. Sanitize data to prevent SQL injection and other security risks
4. Store candidate information in the appropriate database tables
5. Handle CV file uploads, storing files securely and creating database references
6. Implement proper error handling with meaningful error messages
7. Create logging mechanisms for tracking data processing activities
8. Develop a response system to confirm successful data storage or report errors

## Technical Specifications
- Use [specific backend framework, e.g., Node.js with Express, Django, Ruby on Rails]
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Use prepared statements or ORM to interact with the database
- Implement file storage system (local or cloud-based, e.g., AWS S3)
- Use appropriate encryption for sensitive data

## Acceptance Criteria
1. API endpoint successfully receives and processes candidate data
2. All data is properly validated and sanitized before storage
3. Candidate information is correctly stored in the database
4. CV files are successfully uploaded and stored, with database references created
5. Appropriate success or error responses are sent back to the frontend
6. Error handling catches and logs all exceptions without exposing sensitive information
7. System logs provide clear tracking of data processing activities

## Dependencies
- Database schema design for candidate information
- File storage system configuration
- Frontend API integration specifications

## Estimation
- Story Points: 13
- Estimated Time: 5-7 days

## Notes
- Coordinate with the frontend team to ensure API contract alignment
- Discuss data retention policies and implement accordingly
- Consider implementing unit and integration tests for the API endpoints
