# Ticket: Ensure Candidate Data Security and Privacy

## Description
Implement security measures to protect candidate data in the ATS system, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and best practices.

## Objectives
1. Secure data transmission between frontend and backend
2. Implement data encryption for sensitive information
3. Set up access controls and authentication mechanisms
4. Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
5. Implement data retention and deletion policies

## Requirements
1. Configure HTTPS for all data transmissions
2. Implement encryption for sensitive data at rest (e.g., passwords, personal identifiers)
3. Set up role-based access control (RBAC) for the ATS system
4. Implement secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth)
5. Create data retention policies and automated deletion processes
6. Implement audit logging for all data access and modifications
7. Ensure that data export and reporting features comply with privacy regulations
8. Create a privacy policy and terms of service for the ATS system

## Technical Specifications
- Use industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256 for data at rest)
- Implement HTTPS with TLS 1.3
- Use a reputable authentication framework
- Implement database-level encryption for sensitive fields
- Use a secure key management system

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All data transmissions are encrypted using HTTPS
2. Sensitive data is encrypted in the database
3. RBAC is implemented and functioning correctly
4. Authentication system securely manages user sessions
5. Data retention policies are in place and functioning
6. Audit logs capture all necessary information for compliance
7. Privacy policy and terms of service are available to users
8. System passes a basic security audit

## Dependencies
- Completion of backend development ticket
- Access to legal advice for privacy policy creation
- Configuration of production environment

## Estimation
- Story Points: 21
- Estimated Time: 8-10 days

## Notes
- Coordinate with legal team or consultant for compliance requirements
- Consider engaging a third-party security firm for penetration testing
- Plan for regular security audits and updates
- Provide documentation and training for the development team on security best practices
