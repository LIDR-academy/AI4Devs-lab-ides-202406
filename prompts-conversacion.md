sjaca10: @workspace create a database schema for PostgreSQL using Prisma ORM. There will be two tables
  - Applicant
  - ApplicantFiles

The Applicant table will have following fields:
  - id PK BigSerial
  - firstName varchar(120) encrypted
  - lastName varchar(120) encrypted
  - socialSecurityNumber varchar(20) encrypted
  - dateOfBirth date encrypted
  - email varchar(50) encrypted
  - phoneCode varchar(3)
  - phone varchar(10) encrypted
  - street (nullable) varchar(80) encrypted
  - exteriorNumber (nullable) varchar(10) encrypted
  - interiorNumber (nullable) varchar(10) encrypted
  - city varchar(120)
  - country varchar(3)
  - education text encrypted
  - professionalExperiencie text encryptd

All the PII data must be encrypted.

The ApplicantFiles table will have following fields:
  - id PK BigSerial
  - applicantId FK BigSerial => Applicant.id
  - type enum(resume, certification, other)
  - name varchar(100)
  - extension enum(doc, docx, pdf)
  - mimetype varchar(50)
  - path varchar(150)
  - hash text

Create the required migration files to have this structure available in the LTIdb
```

Workspace: To create the database schema for PostgreSQL using Prisma ORM with the specified tables and fields, you need to update the [`schema.prisma`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fprisma%2Fschema.prisma%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/prisma/schema.prisma") file located in [`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fprisma%2Fschema.prisma%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/prisma/schema.prisma"). Below is the updated schema based on your requirements:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Applicant {
  id                    BigInt   @id @default(autoincrement()) @map("id") @db.BigSerial
  firstName             String   @db.VarChar(120)
  lastName              String   @db.VarChar(120)
  socialSecurityNumber  String   @db.VarChar(20)
  dateOfBirth           DateTime @db.Date

  phone                 String   @db.VarChar(10)
  street                String?  @db.VarChar(80)
  exteriorNumber        String?  @db.VarChar(10)
  interiorNumber        String?  @db.VarChar(10)
  city                  String   @db.VarChar(120)
  country               String   @db.VarChar(3)
  education             String
  professionalExperience String
  files                 ApplicantFile[]
}

model ApplicantFile {
  id          BigInt   @id @default(autoincrement()) @map("id") @db.BigSerial
  applicantId BigInt
  type        FileType
  name        String   @db.VarChar(100)
  extension   FileExtension
  mimetype    String   @db.VarChar(50)
  path        String   @db.VarChar(150)
  hash        String
  applicant   Applicant @relation(fields: [applicantId], references: [id])
}

enum FileType {
  resume
  certification
  other
}

enum FileExtension {
  doc
  docx
  pdf
}
```

Please note that Prisma does not directly support field encryption. You will need to handle encryption and decryption in your application logic before saving to or reading from the database.

After updating the schema, you can generate the migration files by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name init_applicant_tables
```

This command will create the migration files in the [`prisma/migrations`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") directory and apply the migration to your database, creating the `Applicant` and `ApplicantFiles` tables with the specified structure in the `LTIdb` database.

sjaca10: @workspace How can I encrypt and decrypt PII data in my application when using Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL?
```

Workspace: To encrypt and decrypt Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data in your application when using Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, you can follow these steps:

1. **Choose an Encryption Library**: Use a Node.js encryption library like `crypto` (built-in) or `bcrypt` for hashing. For encryption and decryption, `crypto` provides a straightforward API.

2. **Encrypt Data Before Saving**: Before saving any data to the database, encrypt the PII fields in your application logic. This can be done in the service layer or before calling Prisma's save methods.

3. **Decrypt Data After Retrieval**: When you retrieve encrypted data from the database, decrypt it in your application logic before using it or sending it to the client.

4. **Use Middleware for Automation (Optional)**: Prisma Middleware allows you to run code before or after a specific Prisma Client query event. You can use middleware to automatically encrypt data before it's saved and decrypt data after it's retrieved.

Here's an example using `crypto` for encryption and decryption, and Prisma Middleware for automation:

```js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { createCipheriv, createDecipheriv, randomBytes, scryptSync } from 'crypto';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

// Encryption and decryption setup
const algorithm = 'aes-256-ctr

';


const secretKey = 'your-secret-key'; // Use a secure key
const iv = randomBytes(16); // Initialization vector

const encrypt = (text) => {
  const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, secretKey, iv);
  const encrypted = Buffer.concat([cipher.update(text), cipher.final()]);
  return {
    iv: iv.toString('hex'),
    content: encrypted.toString('hex')
  };
};

const decrypt = (hash) => {
  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, secretKey, Buffer.from(hash.iv, 'hex'));
  const decrpyted = Buffer.concat([decipher.update(Buffer.from(hash.content, 'hex')), decipher.final()]);
  return decrpyted.toString();
};

// Prisma Middleware for encryption
prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
  if (params.model === 'Applicant' && params.action === 'create') {
    // Encrypt PII fields before saving
    const encryptedFields = ['firstName', 'lastName', 'socialSecurityNumber', 'dateOfBirth', 'email', 'phone'];
    encryptedFields.forEach(field => {
      if (params.args.data[field]) {
        params.args.data[field] = encrypt(params.args.data[field]);
      }
    });
  }
  return next(params);
});

// Example of decryption after retrieval
const getApplicant = async (id) => {
  const applicant = await prisma.applicant.findUnique({ where: { id } });
  if (applicant) {
    // Decrypt PII fields after retrieval
    const decryptedFields = ['firstName', 'lastName', 'socialSecurityNumber', 'dateOfBirth', 'email', 'phone'];
    decryptedFields.forEach(field => {
      if (applicant[field]) {
        applicant[field] = decrypt(applicant[field]);
      }
    });
  }
  return applicant;
};
```

**Important Notes**:
- Replace `'your-secret-key'` with a secure, randomly generated key.
- Store the `secretKey` and `iv` securely (e.g., in environment variables) and ensure they are not hard-coded in your application code.
- Adjust the encryption and decryption logic according to your specific requirements and security standards.
- This example uses synchronous encryption and decryption for simplicity. Consider using asynchronous methods in production for better performance.

For more details on Prisma Middleware, refer to the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/middleware).

Workspace: The warnings and errors you're encountering indicate a few issues with your Docker Compose setup and environment variable configuration:

1. **Environment Variables Not Set**: The warnings about `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_USER`, `DB_NAME`, and `DB_PORT` not being set suggest that Docker Compose is not picking up the environment variables defined in your [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/.env") file. This could be due to the [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/.env") file not being in the same directory as your [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/docker-compose.yml") file or Docker Compose not being configured to use it.

2. **Obsolete [`version`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fversion%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/version") in [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/docker-compose.yml")**: The warning about [`version`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fversion%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/version") being obsolete suggests you're using a newer version of Docker Compose that no longer requires the [`version`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fversion%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/version") key at the top of the [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/docker-compose.yml") file. You can safely remove this key if you're using Docker Compose version 1.27.0 or newer.

3. **Database Initialization Error**: The error from the PostgreSQL container about the database being uninitialized and the superuser password not being specified is because the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable (which is required for initializing the PostgreSQL container) is either not set or not being correctly passed to the container.

To resolve these issues:

- **Ensure [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/.env") File is Recognized**: Make sure your [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/.env") file is in the same directory as your [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/docker-compose.yml") file. Docker Compose automatically picks up the [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/.env") file in its directory. If it's in a different location, you might need to specify the path to the [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/.env") file explicitly using the `--env-file` option when running `docker-compose up`.

- **Configure [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/docker-compose.yml")**: Ensure your [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/docker-compose.yml") file is correctly configured to use the environment variables. Here's an example snippet for the PostgreSQL service:

  ```yaml
  services:
    db:
      image: postgres
      environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USER}
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
        POSTGRES_DB: ${DB_NAME}
      ports:
        - "${DB_PORT}:5432"
  ```

- **Remove `version` Key**: If you're using Docker Compose 1.27.0 or newer, you can remove the `version` key from your `docker-compose.yml` file.

- **Check Environment Variables**: Double-check that your `.env` file contains the correct values for `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, and `DB_PORT`. Also, ensure that `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is set either in your `.env` file or directly in the `docker-compose.yml` under the `environment` section for the PostgreSQL service.

After making these adjustments, try running `docker-compose up` again.

sjaca10: How can I mark a file as untracked in git?
```

GitHub Copilot: To mark a file as untracked in Git, you need to ensure it is not being tracked by Git. This can be done by removing it from the repository if it was previously tracked, and then adding it to the [`.gitignore`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2F.gitignore%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/.gitignore") file to prevent it from being tracked in the future. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Remove the file from the repository (if it was tracked):**
   - First, check if the file is being tracked by Git using `git ls-files <file_path>`. If this command returns the file path, it means the file is being tracked.
   - To stop tracking the file but keep it in your working directory, use `git rm --cached <file_path>`.
   - Commit this change to your repository.

2. **Prevent the file from being tracked in the future:**
   - Add the file or pattern matching the file to your [`.gitignore`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2F.gitignore%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/.gitignore") file. For example, if you want to ignore a file named `example.txt` in the root directory, add `example.txt` to your [`.gitignore`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2F.gitignore%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/.gitignore").
   - If the file is in a subdirectory, you can specify the path relative to the root of your repository, like `subdirectory/example.txt`.

3. **Commit the updated [`.gitignore`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2F.gitignore%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/.gitignore") file:**
   - After updating [`.gitignore`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2F.gitignore%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/.gitignore"), commit this file to your repository.

Here's how you can do it using terminal commands on a Mac:

```bash
# Step 1: Remove the file from being tracked by Git, but keep it in your working directory
git rm --cached <file_path>

# Step 2: Add the file or pattern to .gitignore
echo "<file_path_or_pattern>" >> .gitignore

# Step 3: Commit the changes
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Stop tracking <file_path> and update .gitignore"
```

Replace `<file_path>` with the actual path of your file and `<file_path_or_pattern>` with the file or pattern you want to add to `.gitignore`.

```
sjaca10: In the backend/src folder, create the proper structure to follow a DDD design pattern, then update the README documentation with explanation of the purpose of each new folder in backend/src.
```

GitHub Copilot: To create a structure that follows the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) pattern in the [`backend/src`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/src") folder, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Create the Core DDD Layers:**
   - **Domain:** Contains the business logic and entities. It's the heart of the business application.
   - **Application:** Acts as a mediator between the domain and the infrastructure layers. It contains application logic.
   - **Infrastructure:** Provides technical capabilities that support the layers of the application (e.g., database access, file storage).
   - **Interfaces:** Contains interfaces that the application exposes to the outside world, such as REST APIs, GraphQL, or CLI commands.

2. **Additional Folders:**
   - **Common:** For shared utilities and common functionalities across the application.
   - **Configuration:** For application configurations and settings.

3. **Update the README Documentation:**
   - Explain the purpose of each folder.

- `application/`: Contains the application layer, responsible for orchestrating domain objects to perform application tasks. This layer mediates between the domain and infrastructure layers, defining the application's behavior.

- `domain/`: The core of the business logic. It includes entities, value objects, domain services, and domain events. This layer encapsulates the business rules and knowledge.

- `infrastructure/`: Provides technical capabilities that underpin the application, such as database access, file storage, and external services integration. It implements interfaces defined in the domain layer.

- `interfaces/`: Contains the interfaces that the application exposes to the outside world. This could be REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, or CLI commands. It translates requests from the external world into actions performed by the application layer.

- `common/`: For shared utilities and helpers that are used across different layers of the application. This includes logging, error handling, and other cross-cutting concerns.

- `configuration/`: Holds application configurations, settings, and environment-specific details. This can include database connection settings, API keys, and other configuration parameters.
```

This structure and documentation provide a solid foundation for a DDD-based application, ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

sjaca10: How can I add a new field in a table using Prisma and its migration?
```

GitHub Copilot: To add a new field to a table using Prisma, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Update the Prisma Schema:**
   - First, locate your Prisma schema file, usually named `schema.prisma`.
   - Add the new field to the corresponding model within this file. For example, if you want to add a `createdAt` timestamp field to the `ApplicantFiles` model, you would update it like this:

```prisma
model ApplicantFiles {
  id          BigInt   @id @default(autoincrement())
  applicantId BigInt
  type        String
  name        String   @db.VarChar(100)
  extension   String
  mimetype    String   @db.VarChar(50)
  path        String   @db.VarChar(150)
  hash        String
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now()) // New field
  // Other fields and relations...
}
```

2. **Generate the Migration:**
   - After updating the schema, use the Prisma CLI to create a new migration. This migration will include the SQL needed to alter the table and add the new field.
   - Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_created_at_to_applicant_files
```

   - Replace `add_created_at_to_applicant_files` with a descriptive name for your migration.
   - This command does two things: it generates a new migration file in the `prisma/migrations` directory that includes the SQL for adding the new field, and it applies the migration to your database.

3. **Verify the Migration:**
   - After the migration has been applied, you can verify that the new field has been added by inspecting your database schema or using the Prisma Studio to view the updated model.
   - To open Prisma Studio, run:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

This process allows you to safely add new fields to your database tables using Prisma's migration system, ensuring that your Prisma schema and your database schema stay in sync.

```
sjaca10: Add three new fields to the Applicant and ApplicantFiles tables:
  - createdAt datetime not null default now
  - updatedAt datetime nullable
  - deletedAt datetime nullable
  - createdBy FK BigSerial => User.id

Add a new field to the Applicant table:
  - status enum(new, open, review, interview, screening, negotiation, hired, rejected, declined)
```

GitHub Copilot: To add the specified fields to the `Applicant` and `ApplicantFiles` tables and the new `status` field to the `Applicant` table in your Prisma schema, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Prisma Schema File (`schema.prisma`):**

For the `ApplicantFiles` table:

```prisma
model ApplicantFiles {
  id        BigInt   @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime? // nullable
  deletedAt DateTime? // nullable
  createdBy BigInt    @relation("User", fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId    BigInt
  // Other fields...
}

model User {
  id            BigInt          @id @default(autoincrement())
  ApplicantFiles ApplicantFiles[]
  // Other fields...
}
```

For the `Applicant` table, including the `status` enum:

```prisma
enum Status {
  new
  open
  review
  interview
  screening
  negotiation
  hired
  rejected
  declined
}

model Applicant {
  id        BigInt   @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime? // nullable
  deletedAt DateTime? // nullable
  createdBy BigInt    @relation("User", fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId    BigInt
  status    Status   // enum field
  // Other fields...
}

model User {
  id        BigInt      @id @default(autoincrement())
  Applicants Applicant[]
  // Other fields...
}
```

2. **Generate and Apply the Migration:**

After updating your schema, generate the migration to reflect these changes in your database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_new_fields_to_applicant_and_files
```

This command will create a new migration file for these changes and apply the migration to your database, adding the new fields to the `Applicant` and `ApplicantFiles` tables and creating the `status` enum for the `Applicant` table.

3. **Verify the Changes:**

You can verify the changes by inspecting the migration file in the `prisma/migrations` directory or using Prisma Studio to view the updated tables:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

This process ensures that your database schema is updated to include the new fields and the `status` enum in the `Applicant` table, keeping your Prisma schema in sync with your database.

```
sjaca10: What should be the type of an encrypted field in Prisma for PostgreSQL?
```

GitHub Copilot: For encrypted fields in a PostgreSQL database managed with Prisma, you can use the `String` type in your Prisma schema. The actual encryption and decryption process will happen in your application code, not in the database or Prisma schema itself. When you define a field in Prisma that you plan to encrypt, you simply treat it as a string field. For example:

```prisma
model Applicant {
  id                    BigInt   @id @default(autoincrement())
  firstName             String
  lastName              String
  socialSecurityNumber  String?  // This field will be encrypted
  // Other fields...
}
```

In your application logic, before saving an applicant to the database, you would encrypt the `socialSecurityNumber` field's value. When reading this field from the database, you would decrypt it back to its original form.

Remember, the encryption and decryption processes are handled in the application layer, using a suitable encryption library. Prisma does not provide built-in support for field-level encryption.

```
sjaca10: Which fields can be considered PII?
```

GitHub Copilot: Personal Identifiable Information (PII) refers to any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. In the provided excerpt from the [`schema.prisma`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fprisma%2Fschema.prisma%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/prisma/schema.prisma") file, the following fields can be considered PII:

- `firstName`: A person's first name can identify an individual.
- `lastName`: A person's last name can identify an individual.
- `socialSecurityNumber`: This is a unique identifier for individuals, primarily used in the United States.
- `dateOfBirth`: The birth date of an individual can be used to identify them.
- `email`: An email address can identify an individual and is considered PII.
- `phone`: A phone number is unique to an individual and is considered PII.
- `street`, `exteriorNumber`, `interiorNumber`, `city`, `country`: These fields related to an individual's address can be used to identify where they live and are considered PII.

Handling these fields requires careful consideration of privacy laws and regulations, such as GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California, to ensure the protection of individuals' data.

```
sjaca10: Following DDD design pattern, create the files and the code for an API endpoint `POST /applicant` that will be used to create a new Applicant and store it in the `Applicant` table.

The endpoint must support the following fields as part of the payload and use the Zod library to validate each field:
  - firstName: required, string, not empty, min 2, max 120
  - lastName: required, string, not empty, min 2, max 120
  - socialSecurityNumber: optional, string, min 0, max 20
  - dateOfBirth: optional, date string, min 0, max 20
  - email: required, email string
  - phoneCode: required, ITU-T string, min 2, max 3
  - phone: required, string, max 10
  - street: optional, string, max 80
  - exteriorNumber: optional, string, max 10
  - interiorNumber: optional, string, max 10
  - city: required, string, max 120
  - country: required, ISO-3166-1 alpha-3 string, max 3
  - education: required, text, not empty
  - professionalExperience: required, text, not empty

The PII fields must be stored encrypted.
```

GitHub Copilot: To implement the `POST /applicant` endpoint following the DDD design pattern and using the Zod library for validation, we'll break down the task into steps:

### Step 1: Define the Zod Schema for Validation

Create a file named `applicantValidation.ts` in the `application/validators` directory.

```typescript
// application/validators/applicantValidation.ts
import { z } from 'zod';

export const applicantSchema = z.object({
  firstName: z.string().min(2).max(120),
  lastName: z.string().min(2).max(120),
  socialSecurityNumber: z.string().optional().max(20),
  dateOfBirth: z.string().optional().max(20), // For simplicity, using string; consider using a date library for real applications
  email: z.string().email(),
  phoneCode: z.string().min(2).max(3),
  phone: z.string().max(10),
  street: z.string().optional().max(80),
  exteriorNumber: z.string().optional().max(10),
  interiorNumber: z.string().optional().max(10),
  city: z.string().max(120),
  country: z.string().max(3), // Assuming ISO-3166-1 alpha-3 codes are used
  education: z.string(),
  professionalExperience: z.string(),
});
```

### Step 2: Create the Domain Model

In the `domain/models` directory, create a file named `Applicant.ts`.

```typescript
// domain/models/Applicant.ts
export interface Applicant {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  socialSecurityNumber?: string;
  dateOfBirth?: string;
  email: string;
  phoneCode: string;
  phone: string;
  street?: string;
  exteriorNumber?: string;
  interiorNumber?: string;
  city: string;
  country: string;
  education: string;
  professionalExperience: string;
}
```

### Step 3: Implement the Application Logic

In the `application/use_cases` directory, create a file named `CreateApplicant.ts`.

```typescript
// application/use_cases/CreateApplicant.ts
import { Applicant } from '../../domain/models/Applicant';
import { applicantRepository } from '../../infrastructure/persistence'; // Assume this is implemented

export const createApplicant = async (applicantData: Applicant) => {
  // Here, you would encrypt the PII fields before saving
  const encryptedData = {
    ...applicantData,
    // Encrypt PII fields here
  };

  return await applicantRepository.add(encryptedData);
};
```

### Step 4: Create the Controller

In the `interfaces/controllers` directory, create a file named `ApplicantController.ts`.

```typescript
// interfaces/controllers/ApplicantController.ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { applicantSchema } from '../../application/validators/applicantValidation';
import { createApplicant } from '../../application/use_cases/CreateApplicant';

export const postApplicant = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const parsedData = applicantSchema.parse(req.body);
    const result = await createApplicant(parsedData);
    res.status(201).json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
  }
};
```

### Step 5: Set Up the Route

In your Express app setup file or a specific routes file, add the route for the `POST /applicant` endpoint.

```typescript
// Assuming Express setup in app.ts or similar
import express from 'express';
import { postApplicant } from './interfaces/controllers/ApplicantController';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/applicant', postApplicant);

// Other setup like error handling, listening to a port, etc.
```

### Note:

- This example assumes you have an infrastructure layer with a repository named `applicantRepository` for interacting with the database. You'll need to implement this part based on your database choice.
- For encryption, you would use a library suitable for your needs, such as `crypto` in Node.js, to encrypt the PII fields before saving them to the database.
- The validation and encryption logic might need adjustments based on your exact requirements and the libraries you choose to use.

```
sjaca10: Following DDD design pattern, create the files and the code for an API endpoint `POST /applicant` that will be used to create a new Applicant and store it in the `Applicant` table.

The endpoint must support the following fields as part of the payload and use the Zod library to validate each field:
  - firstName: required, string, not empty, min 2, max 120
  - lastName: required, string, not empty, min 2, max 120
  - socialSecurityNumber: optional, string, min 0, max 20
  - dateOfBirth: optional, date string, min 0, max 20
  - email: required, email string
  - phoneCode: required, ITU-T string, min 2, max 3
  - phone: required, string, max 10
  - street: optional, string, max 80
  - exteriorNumber: optional, string, max 10
  - interiorNumber: optional, string, max 10
  - city: required, string, max 120
  - country: required, ISO-3166-1 alpha-3 string, max 3
  - education: required, text, not empty
  - professionalExperience: required, text, not empty

The PII fields must be stored encrypted.

The endpoint must returns the following statuses
  - 201 Created in case the Applicant creation was success
  - 400 Bad Request in case the payload contains errors
  - 500 Internal Server Error in case of an unexpected error
```

GitHub Copilot: Given the requirements, let's outline the steps to create the `POST /applicant` endpoint following the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) pattern, using Express.js for the web framework and Zod for payload validation.

### Step 1: Define the Zod Schema for Validation

**File:** `src/application/validators/applicantValidation.ts`

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

export const applicantSchema = z.object({
  firstName: z.string().min(2).max(120).nonempty(),
  lastName: z.string().min(2).max(120).nonempty(),
  socialSecurityNumber: z.string().optional().max(20),
  dateOfBirth: z.string().optional().max(20), // Consider using a date validation library
  email: z.string().email(),
  phoneCode: z.string().min(2).max(3),
  phone: z.string().max(10),
  street: z.string().optional().max(80),
  exteriorNumber: z.string().optional().max(10),
  interiorNumber: z.string().optional().max(10),
  city: z.string().max(120),
  country: z.string().max(3), // Assuming ISO-3166-1 alpha-3
  education: z.string().nonempty(),
  professionalExperience: z.string().nonempty(),
});
```

### Step 2: Create the Domain Model

**File:** `src/domain/models/Applicant.ts`

```typescript
export interface Applicant {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  socialSecurityNumber?: string;
  dateOfBirth?: string;
  email: string;
  phoneCode: string;
  phone: string;
  street?: string;
  exteriorNumber?: string;
  interiorNumber?: string;
  city: string;
  country: string;
  education: string;
  professionalExperience: string;
}
```

### Step 3: Implement the Application Logic

**File:** `src/application/use_cases/CreateApplicant.ts`

```typescript
import { Applicant } from '../../domain/models/Applicant';
import { applicantRepository } from '../../infrastructure/persistence/applicantRepository'; // Placeholder path
import { encryptPII } from '../../infrastructure/security/encryption'; // Placeholder for encryption function

export async function createApplicant(applicantData: Applicant) {
  const encryptedData = encryptPII(applicantData); // Encrypt PII fields
  return applicantRepository.add(encryptedData);
}
```

### Step 4: Create the Controller

**File:** `src/interfaces/controllers/ApplicantController.ts`

```typescript
import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { applicantSchema } from '../../application/validators/applicantValidation';
import { createApplicant } from '../../application/use_cases/CreateApplicant';

export async function postApplicant(req: Request, res: Response) {
  try {
    const parsedData = applicantSchema.parse(req.body);
    await createApplicant(parsedData);
    res.status(201).send("Applicant created successfully.");
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ZodError) {
      res.status(400).json({ error: error.errors });
    } else {
      console.error(error);
      res.status(500).send("Internal Server Error");
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Set Up the Route

**File:** `src/app.ts` (or wherever you configure your Express app)

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { postApplicant } from './interfaces/controllers/ApplicantController';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/applicant', postApplicant);

// Other setup like error handling, listening to a port, etc.

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### Additional Notes:

- Ensure you have a function `encryptPII` for encrypting PII fields. This function is not detailed here but should use a secure encryption method suitable for your requirements.
- The `applicantRepository.add` method is assumed to be part of your infrastructure layer for database interactions, which needs to be implemented according to your database setup.
- Error handling in the controller is simplified. Depending on your application's needs, you might want to add more detailed error responses or logging.

```
sjaca10: How can I configure encryption for PII fields in a Node.js application?
```

GitHub Copilot: To configure encryption for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) fields in a Node.js application, you can use the `crypto` module, which is built into Node.js. Here's a step-by-step guide to set up a simple encryption and decryption mechanism:

### Step 1: Import the Crypto Module

First, you need to import the `crypto` module provided by Node.js.

### Step 2: Define Encryption and Decryption Functions

You'll define functions for both encryption and decryption. These functions will use symmetric encryption, where the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting data.

### Step 3: Use the Encryption Function

Before saving any PII data to your database, you'll use the encryption function to encrypt the data.

### Step 4: Use the Decryption Function

When you retrieve PII data from your database and need to use it in your application, you'll use the decryption function to decrypt the data.

Here's an example implementation:

```typescript
import crypto from 'crypto';

// Encryption & Decryption configuration
const algorithm = 'aes-256-cbc'; // Symmetric encryption algorithm
const

 secret

Key = 'your-32-characters-long-secret-key'; // Must be 32 characters
const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16); // Initialization vector

// Encrypt function
const encrypt = (text: string) => {
  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, Buffer.from(secretKey), iv);
  let encrypted = cipher.update(text);
  encrypted = Buffer.concat([encrypted, cipher.final()]);
  return { iv: iv.toString('hex'), encryptedData: encrypted.toString('hex') };
};

// Decrypt function
const decrypt = (encryption: { iv: string; encryptedData: string }) => {
  const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(algorithm, Buffer.from(secretKey), Buffer.from(encryption.iv, 'hex'));
  let decrypted = decipher.update(Buffer.from(encryption.encryptedData, 'hex'));
  decrypted = Buffer.concat([decrypted, decipher.final()]);
  return decrypted.toString();
};

// Example usage
const encryptedPII = encrypt('Sensitive PII Data');
console.log('Encrypted:', encryptedPII);

const decryptedPII = decrypt(encryptedPII);
console.log('Decrypted:', decryptedPII);
```

### Important Considerations:

- **Key Management:** The secret key used for encryption/decryption is extremely sensitive. It should be stored securely and not hard-coded in your application code. Consider using environment variables or a secure secrets management service.
- **IV Uniqueness:** The Initialization Vector (IV) should be unique for each encryption operation but does not need to be secret. It's common to store the IV alongside the encrypted data.
- **Security Compliance:** Ensure your encryption strategy complies with relevant laws and regulations for handling PII.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for your encryption and decryption functions to manage any potential issues gracefully.

This example provides a basic approach to encrypting and decrypting PII data in a Node.js application. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to adjust the encryption algorithm, key management strategy, or other aspects of the implementation.

The core of the issue is that TypeScript is unable to match the type of [`args`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A31%2C%22character%22%3A10%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") you've provided with what's expected. This could be due to several reasons, such as missing properties, incompatible property types, or issues with how generics are being used.

### Key Points in the Error Message

1. **Type Incompatibility**: The type you're providing ([`Prisma.ApplicantCreateArgs & { data: Prisma.ApplicantCreateInput }`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A234%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts")) is not assignable to what's expected. This suggests a mismatch in the structure or properties of the types.

2. **Missing [`data`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A31%2C%22character%22%3A47%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") Property**: The error specifically mentions that the [`data`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A31%2C%22character%22%3A47%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") property is missing in the provided type, but it's required in [`ApplicantCreateArgs<DefaultArgs>`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3151%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts").

### Possible Solutions

1. **Review Type Definitions**: Ensure that the [`Prisma.ApplicantCreateArgs`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A234%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts") and [`Prisma.ApplicantCreateInput`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A234%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts") types are correctly defined and include all necessary properties. It's possible that the expected type structure has changed or that there's a misunderstanding of what properties are required.

2. **Ensure Compatibility with `DynamicQueryExtensionCb`**: If you have control over the `DynamicQueryExtensionCb` type or how it's used, you might need to adjust it to be more flexible or to correctly reflect the types of arguments it should accept.

3. **Explicit Type Casting**: As a last resort, and if you're confident in the compatibility of your types, you could use type casting to bypass the TypeScript error. However, this should be done with caution, as it bypasses type checking:

   ```typescript
   // Example of explicit type casting (use cautiously)
   const argsCasted = args as unknown as DynamicQueryExtensionCbArgs<TypeMap<InternalArgs & DefaultArgs>, "model", "Applicant", "create">;
   ```

### Conclusion

This error is a complex type compatibility issue that requires a careful review of the types involved (`Prisma.ApplicantCreateArgs`, `Prisma.ApplicantCreateInput`, and the expected `DynamicQueryExtensionCb` type). Ensure that all properties match up and consider adjusting type definitions or the way generics are used to resolve the issue.

sjaca10: Usage of keyof in TS
```

GitHub Copilot: The `keyof` type operator in TypeScript is used to create a union type consisting of all the literal types of the keys of an object type. It's useful for ensuring that string arguments or variables correspond to the property names of an object. Here's a step-by-step explanation and example usage:

1. **Define an Object Type**: First, you define an object type. This could be an interface or a type alias.

2. **Use `keyof`**: Apply `keyof` to the object type to generate a union type of its keys.

3. **Use the Generated Type**: The generated type can be used as the type for variables or function parameters to ensure they match one of the object's keys.

### Example

```typescript
// Step 1: Define an object type
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Step 2: Use `keyof` with the object type
type UserKeys = keyof User; // "id" | "name" | "email"

// Step 3: Use the generated type
function getUserProperty(user: User, propertyName: UserKeys) {
  return user[propertyName];
}

// Example usage
const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
};

console.log(getUserProperty(user, 'name')); // John Doe
// The argument for propertyName must be one of 'id', 'name', or 'email'.
```

In this example, `keyof User` generates a union type `"id" | "name" | "email"`, which is then used to type the `propertyName` parameter in the `getUserProperty` function. This ensures that `propertyName` can only be one of the keys of the `User` object, providing a type-safe way to access object properties.

```
sjaca10: Array of keyof TS
```

GitHub Copilot: To create an array of `keyof` in TypeScript, you would typically define an object type and then use the `keyof` type operator to get a union type of its keys. To represent this as an array, you can use the array type notation. Here's how you can do it step by step:

1. **Define an Object Type**: Start by defining an object type, either using an interface or a type alias.

2. **Use `keyof` with the Object Type**: Apply `keyof` to the object type to generate a union type of its keys.

3. **Create an Array Type**: Use the generated union type with array notation to define an array type that can hold any of the keys.

### Example

```typescript
// Step 1: Define an object type
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Step 2: Use `keyof` with the object type
type UserKey = keyof User; // "id" | "name" | "email"

// Step 3: Create an array type of the keys
type UserKeyArray = UserKey[];

// Example usage
const userKeys: UserKeyArray = ['id', 'name', 'email']; // Valid
const userKeysInvalid: UserKeyArray = ['id', 'name', 'username']; // Error: "username" is not a key of User
```

In this example, `UserKey` is a union type of the keys of the `User` object (`"id" | "name" | "email"`). `UserKeyArray` is then defined as an array of `UserKey`, meaning it can hold any combination of the strings `'id'`, `'name'`, and `'email'`. Attempting to include any string not corresponding to a key of `User` in `userKeysInvalid` results in a type error.

sjaca10: @terminal /explain #terminalSelection
```

Workspace: The error message you're encountering, `Uncaught RangeError: Invalid key length`, is related to the use of cryptographic functions in Node.js, specifically when creating a cipher instance with `createCipheriv`. This error occurs because the key length you've provided does not match the expected length for the encryption algorithm you're trying to use.

Given the context from your [`crypt.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") file, where only [`iv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") (Initialization Vector) is mentioned without showing the key or the algorithm, here are a few points to consider:

1. **Check the Algorithm**: Different algorithms require keys of different lengths. For example, AES-256 requires a 256-bit key (which is 32 bytes), AES-128 requires a 128-bit key (16 bytes), etc. Ensure you're using a key of the correct length for your chosen algorithm.

2. **Key Length**: The error specifically mentions an invalid key length. This means you need to verify the size of the key you're passing to `createCipheriv`. If you're generating the key dynamically, ensure its size matches the requirements of your encryption algorithm.

3. **Initialization Vector (IV)**: While the error does not directly relate to the IV, it's important to ensure that the IV is also correctly sized for the algorithm. Typically, block ciphers like AES require the IV to be the same size as the block (16 bytes for AES).

Here's a basic example of using `createCipheriv` correctly with AES-256-CBC in Node.js. Ensure your key is 32 bytes and your IV is 16 bytes:

```typescript
import { createCipheriv, randomBytes } from 'crypto';

// Example using AES-256-CBC
const algorithm = 'aes-256-cbc';
const key = randomBytes(32); // Key must be 32 bytes for AES-256
const iv = randomBytes(16); // IV must be 16 bytes

const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);
```

If you're hardcoding the key or generating it in some way, double-check its length. If you're using a passphrase to generate the key, consider using a key derivation function (like PBKDF2) that allows you to specify the desired key length.

Lastly, ensure that the algorithm you're using is correctly specified and supported in your Node.js environment. Different versions of Node.js might have slightly different crypto APIs or supported algorithms.

sjaca10: JS randomByte() to text
```

GitHub Copilot: To convert the output of `randomBytes()` to a text format (e.g., hexadecimal or base64), you can use the `toString` method provided by the [`Buffer`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2FLibrary%2FCaches%2Ftypescript%2F5.5%2Fnode_modules%2F%2540types%2Fnode%2Fbuffer.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2FLibrary%2FCaches%2Ftypescript%2F5.5%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Fnode%2Fbuffer.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A631%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "../../Library/Caches/typescript/5.5/node_modules/@types/node/buffer.d.ts") class in Node.js. This method allows you to specify the encoding format you want to convert the binary data to. Common formats include 'hex', 'base64', and 'utf8'.

Here's how you can modify the `randomBytes` usage in your code to convert the generated bytes to text in hexadecimal and base64 formats:

```javascript
randomBytes = require('crypto').randomBytes;
createCipheriv = require('crypto').createCipheriv;

algorithm = 'aes-256-ctr';
secretKey = randomBytes(32); // Use a secure key
iv = randomBytes(16); // Initialization vector

// Convert secretKey and iv to text (hex and

 base

64 for demonstration)
secretKeyHex = secretKey.toString('hex');
secretKeyBase64 = secretKey.toString('base64');
ivHex = iv.toString('hex');
ivBase64 = iv.toString('base64');

encrypt = (text) => {
  cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, secretKey, iv);
  encrypted = Buffer.concat([cipher.update(text, 'utf8'), cipher.final()]);
  return {
    iv: iv.toString('hex'), // iv in hex format
    content: encrypted.toString('hex') // encrypted content in hex format
  };
};

// Example: Logging the hex and base64 representations
console.log(`Secret Key (Hex): ${secretKeyHex}`);
console.log(`Secret Key (Base64): ${secretKeyBase64}`);
console.log(`IV (Hex): ${ivHex}`);
console.log(`IV (Base64): ${ivBase64}`);
```

In this example, after generating the `secretKey` and `iv` using `randomBytes()`, their binary data is converted to both hexadecimal and base64 string formats using `toString('hex')` and `toString('base64')`, respectively. This allows you to see or store these values in a more readable or transportable format.

GitHub Copilot: To store the [`iv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") (Initialization Vector) and the encrypted [`content`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") in a database after using the [`encrypt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") function from your provided code snippet, you can follow these steps:

1. **Database Schema Design**: Ensure your database schema includes fields to store both the [`iv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") and the encrypted [`content`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts"). Typically, these are stored as strings. For example, in a SQL database, you might have a table with columns `encrypted_data` and [`iv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts"), both of type `VARCHAR` or `TEXT`, depending on the expected size.

2. **Conversion to Storable Format**: Since the [`encrypt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") function returns both [`iv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") and [`content`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") in hexadecimal string format, they are already in a suitable format to be stored directly in the database.

3. **Insertion into the Database**: Use your database's query language or ORM to insert the [`iv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") and [`content`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") into the database.

Here's an example of how you might adjust your [`create`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A32%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") method to include storing the [`iv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") and encrypted [`content`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") for an [`Applicant`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fdomain%2Fmodels%2FApplicant.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/domain/models/Applicant.ts") model, assuming `encryptedData` is a field in your [`Applicant`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fdomain%2Fmodels%2FApplicant.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/domain/models/Applicant.ts") model that stores the encrypted content and `encryptionIv` stores the IV:

```typescript
prisma.$extends({
  query: {
    applicant: {
      async create({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        // Assuming args contains the fields to be encrypted
        const encryptedFields: Array<keyof Applicant> = ['firstName', 'lastName', 'socialSecurityNumber', 'dateOfBirth', 'email', 'phone'];
        
        // Object to hold encrypted data
        let encryptedData = {};

        encryptedFields.forEach(field => {
          if (args[field]) {
            const encrypted = encrypt(args[field]);
            // Store encrypted content and iv in encryptedData object
            encryptedData[field] = encrypted.content;
            encryptedData[`${field}Iv`] = encrypted.iv; // Assuming there's a corresponding IV field for each encrypted field
            delete args[field]; // Remove the plaintext field from args
          }
        });

        // Add encryptedData to args or handle it according to your schema
        args.encryptedData = JSON.stringify(encryptedData); // Example if storing all encrypted fields as a JSON string
        // args.encryptionIv = encrypted.iv; // Example if storing a single IV for all fields, adjust as necessary

        // Proceed with the creation using the modified args
        return prisma.applicant.create({
          data: args,
          ...query,
        });
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This example assumes that you're encrypting multiple fields and possibly storing them as a JSON string in a single `encryptedData` field in your database. Adjust the implementation based on your actual database schema and requirements, such as handling each encrypted field separately or storing the IVs in a way that matches your encryption strategy.

sjaca10: How to store iv and content in a single field in the database in an encrypted way?
```

GitHub Copilot: To store the `iv` (Initialization Vector) and the encrypted content in a single field in the database in an encrypted way, you can follow these steps:

1. **Encrypt the Data**: Use the [`createCipheriv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2FLibrary%2FCaches%2Ftypescript%2F5.5%2Fnode_modules%2F%2540types%2Fnode%2Fcrypto.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2FLibrary%2FCaches%2Ftypescript%2F5.5%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Fnode%2Fcrypto.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A762%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "../../Library/Caches/typescript/5.5/node_modules/@types/node/crypto.d.ts") method to encrypt your data. This part is already done in your code.
2. **Concatenate IV and Encrypted Data**: After encryption, concatenate the `iv` with the encrypted data. Since both are buffers, you can easily concatenate them.
3. **Convert to Base64**: Convert the concatenated buffer to a Base64 string. This makes it easier to store in a database as a single text field.
4. **Decryption Process**: For decryption, you'll need to extract the `iv` and the encrypted content from the Base64 string, then use them with [`createDecipheriv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2FLibrary%2FCaches%2Ftypescript%2F5.5%2Fnode_modules%2F%2540types%2Fnode%2Fcrypto.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2FLibrary%2FCaches%2Ftypescript%2F5.5%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Fnode%2Fcrypto.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1039%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "../../Library/Caches/typescript/5.5/node_modules/@types/node/crypto.d.ts") to decrypt the data.

Here's how you can modify your code to include these steps:

```javascript
const randomBytes = require('crypto').randomBytes;
const createCipheriv = require('crypto').createCipheriv;
const createDecipheriv = require('crypto').createDecipheriv;

// Your encryption key
const key = Buffer

.from

('WiDEuWIPoiUCQLjnVZNCkdT+Q1cqsHYfwGmDj31+HeE=', 'base64');

// Data to encrypt
const data = "Javier Aguila";

// Generate an IV
const iv = randomBytes(16);

// Create a cipher
const cipher = createCipheriv('aes-256-ctr', key, iv);

// Encrypt the data
const encrypted = Buffer.concat([cipher.update(data, 'utf8'), cipher.final()]);

// Concatenate IV and encrypted data, then convert to Base64 for storage
const hash = Buffer.concat([iv, encrypted]).toString('base64');

// Assuming hash is retrieved from the database and contains both IV and encrypted data
const buffer = Buffer.from(hash, 'base64');

// Extract IV and encrypted content from the buffer
const ivFromHash = buffer.slice(0, 16);
const contentFromHash = buffer.slice(16);

// Decrypt the data
const decipher = createDecipheriv('aes-256-ctr', key, ivFromHash);
const decrypted = Buffer.concat([decipher.update(contentFromHash), decipher.final()]);

// Convert decrypted data back to a string
const decryptedString = decrypted.toString();

console.log(decryptedString); // Outputs: Javier Aguila
```

This approach ensures that both the `iv` and the encrypted content are stored together in a single field, making it easier to manage while keeping the encryption process secure.

After validation with Zod, the [`applicant`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Finterfaces%2Fcontrollers%2FApplicantController.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Finterfaces%2Fcontrollers%2FApplicantController.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Finterfaces%2Fcontrollers%2FApplicantController.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/interfaces/controllers/ApplicantController.ts") object contains the validated data which is then directly passed to Prisma's [`create`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F.prisma%2Fclient%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2664%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts") method. Here's the relevant part of your code with comments for clarity:

```typescript
// Validate the request body against the applicantSchema using Zod
const applicant = applicantSchema.parse(req.body);

// Initialize PrismaClient
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

// Use the validated applicant data to create a new record in the database
const createdApplicant = await prisma.applicant.create({
  data: applicant, // This is where the validated data is passed to Prisma
});
```

This approach is correct and efficient for passing validated data to Prisma. The `applicantSchema.parse(req.body)` call validates the incoming request body against the schema defined with Zod. If the validation passes, it returns the validated data object, which is then directly used in the `prisma.applicant.create` call.

If the validation fails, Zod throws a `ZodError`, which you catch and handle appropriately by returning a 400 status code along with the validation errors. This ensures that only valid data as per your Zod schema is passed to Prisma for database insertion.

sjaca10: The data was stored in plain text, it seems the Prisma middleware to encrypt the data before save wasn't executed, how can I solve it?
```

GitHub Copilot: To ensure that your data is encrypted before being saved to the database using Prisma, you need to add a middleware to Prisma that intercepts the `create` and [`update`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Fnode%2Fcrypto.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A920%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/@types/node/crypto.d.ts") operations on your models and encrypts the relevant fields. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Define Middleware**: Define a middleware function that checks for `create` and [`update`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Fnode%2Fcrypto.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A920%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/@types/node/crypto.d.ts") actions. For these actions, encrypt the specified fields before the operation proceeds.
2. **Apply Middleware**: Use [`prisma.$use()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") to apply the middleware.

```typescript
// Assuming prisma and encrypt function are already defined as per your crypt.ts file

// Middleware to encrypt data before saving
prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
  // Check if the operation is create or update
  if (params.model === 'YourModelName' && (params.action === 'create' || params.action === 'update')) {
    // Assuming 'sensitiveData' is the field you want to encrypt
    if (params.args.data.sensitiveData) {
      // Encrypt the sensitiveData field
      params.args.data.sensitiveData = encrypt(params.args.data.sensitiveData);
    }
  }

  // Continue the operation
  return next(params);
});

// Example usage
async function createRecord() {
  await prisma.yourModelName.create({
    data: {
      // your data fields, including 'sensitiveData'
      sensitiveData: 'Some sensitive data',
    },
  });
}

// Don't forget to replace 'YourModelName' with your actual model name and 'sensitiveData' with the actual field name you wish to encrypt.
```

**Important Considerations**:
- **Model and Field Names**: Replace `'YourModelName'` with the actual name of the model you're working with and `'sensitiveData'` with the field you intend to encrypt.
- **Decryption**: Remember that the data will be stored in an encrypted form in the database. You'll need to decrypt it after fetching it from the database. This can be done manually or through another middleware that intercepts the `find` operations.
- **Performance**: Be aware that encryption and decryption can add overhead to your database operations. Test the performance impact on your application.
- **Security**: Ensure that your encryption key (`ENCRYPTION_KEY`) is securely managed and not hardcoded or stored in your codebase.

This middleware approach allows you to seamlessly integrate encryption into your data handling flow with Prisma, ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted before being stored in the database.

GitHub Copilot: To integrate a Prisma middleware for encryption in your existing [`crypt.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") file, you should place the middleware setup after defining the [`encrypt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") and [`decrypt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") functions to ensure they are available for use within the middleware. Here's how you can extend your [`crypt.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fmiddlewares%2Fcrypt.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-lab-ides/backend/src/common/middlewares/crypt.ts") file to include the Prisma middleware for encrypting data before saving it to the database:

```typescript
// Continue from the existing code...

const decrypt = (encrypted: string): string => {
  const hash = Buffer.from(encrypted, 'base64');
  const iv = hash.subarray(0, 16);
  const content = hash.subarray(16);
  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);
  const decrypted = Buffer.concat([decipher.update(content), decipher.final()]);

  return decrypted.toString();
};

// Prisma Middleware for encrypting data
prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
  // Check if the operation is create or update on a specific model
  if (params.model === 'YourModelName' && (params.action === 'create' || params.action === 'update')) {
    // Assuming 'sensitiveData' is the field you want to encrypt
    if (params.args.data.sensitiveData) {
      // Encrypt the sensitiveData field
      params.args.data.sensitiveData = encrypt(params.args.data.sensitiveData.toString());
    }
  }

  // Continue the operation
  return next(params);
});

// Export prisma and encryption functions if needed elsewhere
export { prisma, encrypt, decrypt };
```

**Key Points**:
- **Middleware Placement**: The middleware is defined after the `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions to ensure they are declared before being used.
- **Model Name**: Replace `'YourModelName'` with the actual name of the model you're working with.
- **Sensitive Data Field**: Replace `'sensitiveData'` with the actual field name you wish to encrypt.
- **Data Conversion**: Ensure data passed to `encrypt` is in the correct format. Since `encrypt` expects a `BinaryLike` argument, converting the data to a string (`toString()`) might be necessary depending on your data type.
- **Exporting**: If you plan to use `prisma`, `encrypt`, or `decrypt` elsewhere in your application, make sure to export them.

This setup ensures that your sensitive data is encrypted before being saved to the database and remains central to your `crypt.ts` file, making it easy to manage encryption-related logic in one place.

This is a limitation of the JSON format, which does not officially support `BigInt`. In your code, when you attempt to send [`createdApplicant`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Finterfaces%2Fcontrollers%2FApplicantController.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Finterfaces%2Fcontrollers%2FApplicantController.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Finterfaces%2Fcontrollers%2FApplicantController.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/interfaces/controllers/ApplicantController.ts") as a JSON response, if any of the properties of [`createdApplicant`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Finterfaces%2Fcontrollers%2FApplicantController.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Finterfaces%2Fcontrollers%2FApplicantController.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Finterfaces%2Fcontrollers%2FApplicantController.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/interfaces/controllers/ApplicantController.ts") are of type `BigInt`, this error will be thrown.

To resolve this issue, you can provide a custom replacer function to [`JSON.stringify()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FApplications%2FVisual%2520Studio%2520Code.app%2FContents%2FResources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.symbol.wellknown.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FApplications%2FVisual%20Studio%20Code.app%2FContents%2FResources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.symbol.wellknown.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A151%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2015.symbol.wellknown.d.ts") that handles `BigInt` values. One common approach is to convert `BigInt` values to strings. Here's how you can modify your code to include such a replacer function:

```typescript
res.status(201).send(JSON.stringify(createdApplicant, (key, value) =>
  typeof value === 'bigint' ? value.toString() : value // Convert BigInt to string
));
```

This replacer function checks if the current value being serialized is of type `bigint`. If it is, the function converts the `BigInt` value to a string. Otherwise, it returns the value unchanged. This allows `JSON.stringify()` to successfully serialize the object, including any `BigInt` values it may contain.

Remember, converting `BigInt` to strings might be acceptable for serialization purposes, but it's important to ensure that the receiving end of this data knows how to handle these stringified `BigInt` values, especially if it needs to perform arithmetic operations or comparisons on them.

Workspace: The error message you're encountering suggests that you're using a version of `react-router-dom` where [`Switch`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/App.tsx") is not exported. This is likely because you're using `react-router-dom` version 6 or later, where [`Switch`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/App.tsx") has been replaced with `Routes`.

In `react-router-dom` v6, the routing API has undergone significant changes to improve the composition and flexibility of routes. One of the notable changes is the replacement of [`Switch`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/App.tsx") with `Routes`. The `Routes` component is used to define a group of [`Route`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2Freact-router%2Fdist%2Flib%2Fcomponents.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A101%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/react-router/dist/lib/components.d.ts") components, similar to how [`Switch`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/App.tsx") was used, but with more capabilities and a slightly different API.

Here's how you can update your code to be compatible with `react-router-dom` v6:

```tsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Dashboard />} exact />
        <Route path="/add-applicant" element={<ApplicantForm />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

Key changes to note:

- `Switch` is replaced with `Routes`.
- The `component` prop is replaced with `element`, and you pass the component as JSX (`<Component />`) instead of a reference (`Component`).
- The `exact` prop is no longer needed. In v6, all routes are exact by default. The route will only match if the path matches exactly.

These changes should resolve the error and make your routing configuration compatible with `react-router-dom` version 6.

```

In v6, the behavior that was previously achieved with the [`exact`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A48%7D%5D "frontend/src/App.tsx") prop is now the default behavior. Every route is considered exact, meaning it will only match if the path matches the location’s pathname exactly. This is a change from previous versions where you had to explicitly specify [`exact`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A48%7D%5D "frontend/src/App.tsx") to avoid matching on partial pathnames.

Here's how you can correct your code by removing the [`exact`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A48%7D%5D "frontend/src/App.tsx") prop:

```tsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Dashboard from './Dashboard'; // Assuming the import path
import ApplicantForm from './ApplicantForm'; // Assuming the import path

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Dashboard />} />
        <Route path="/add-applicant" element={<ApplicantForm />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

This updated code snippet is compatible with `react-router-dom` v6 and should resolve the error you're seeing. Remember, in v6, routes are exact by default, and the `exact` prop is no longer needed or recognized.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Drawer, List, ListItem, ListItemIcon, ListItemText } from '@mui/material';
import PeopleIcon from '@mui/icons-material/People';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'; // Updated import

function Dashboard() {
  const navigate = useNavigate(); // Updated to use useNavigate

  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
      <Drawer variant="permanent" anchor="left">
        <List>
          <ListItem button onClick={() => navigate('/add-applicant')}> {/* Updated to use navigate */}

        {/* Main content goes here */}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Dashboard;
```

In this updated code, `useNavigate` is used to obtain a `navigate` function, which you can then call with the path you want to navigate to, similar to how you previously used `history.push`. This change aligns with the API updates introduced in `react-router-dom` v6.

This typically involves placing the [`Dashboard`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx") component outside of the switch statement that handles routing, or incorporating it into a layout component that wraps around your page content. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Create a Layout Component**: This component will include the [`Dashboard`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx") and a `Outlet` component from [`react-router-dom`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts") v6 (which replaces the use of `Route` components for rendering nested routes).

2. **Use the Layout Component in Your Routes**: Apply this layout to your routes so that the [`Dashboard`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx") is always rendered, regardless of which route is matched.

### Step 1: Create a Layout Component

```tsx
// LayoutWithDashboard.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
import Dashboard from './Dashboard'; // Adjust the import path as necessary

const LayoutWithDashboard = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Dashboard />
      <div>
        {/* Outlet is a placeholder for the matched child route */}
        <Outlet />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default LayoutWithDashboard;
```

### Step 2: Use the Layout Component in Your Routes

Assuming you're using `react-router-dom` v6, you can structure your routes like this:

```tsx
// App.tsx or wherever you define your routes
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import LayoutWithDashboard from './LayoutWithDashboard'; // Adjust the import path as necessary
import HomePage from './HomePage'; // Import your page components
import AnotherPage from './AnotherPage';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<LayoutWithDashboard />}>
          {/* Define your routes as children of the layout route */}
          <Route index element={<HomePage />} />
          <Route path="another-page" element={<AnotherPage />} />
          {/* Add more routes as needed */}
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This setup ensures that the [`Dashboard`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx") component is always visible, regardless of which route is currently active, by embedding it within the `LayoutWithDashboard` component that wraps around all your main routes.

sjaca10: How can I add a navigation bar to my React application using Material UI?
```

GitHub Copilot: To add a navigation bar to your React application using Material UI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Material UI**: If you haven't already, you need to install Material UI in your project.

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

2. **Create a Navigation Bar Component**: You can create a new component for your navigation bar. This component will use Material UI's `AppBar` and `Toolbar` components to create a basic navigation bar.

3. **Add Links**: Use the `Button` component from Material UI to add links in the `Toolbar`. You can use React Router's `Link` component to navigate between pages.

4. **Integrate the Navigation Bar**: Include your navigation bar component in your application layout, typically at the top of your main component or layout component.

Here's an example of how you can create a simple navigation bar component using Material UI:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AppBar, Toolbar, Typography, Button } from '@mui/material';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function NavigationBar() {
  return (
    <AppBar position="static">
      <Toolbar>
        <Typography variant="h6" component="div" sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
          My Application
        </Typography>
        <Button color="inherit" component={Link} to="/">Home</Button>
        <Button color="inherit" component={Link} to="/about">About</Button>
        <Button color="inherit" component={Link} to="/contact">Contact</Button>
      </Toolbar>
    </AppBar>
  );
}

export default NavigationBar;
```

**Integrating the Navigation Bar in Your Application:**

- Import and use the `NavigationBar` component in your main application component or wherever you manage your layout.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import NavigationBar from './NavigationBar'; // Adjust the import path according to your file structure
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import HomePage from './HomePage'; // Your component for the Home page
import AboutPage from './AboutPage'; // Your component for the About page
import ContactPage from './ContactPage'; // Your component for the Contact page

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <NavigationBar />
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
        <Route path="/contact" element={<ContactPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This setup provides a basic navigation bar at the top of your application, using Material UI components and integrating with React Router for navigation.

sjaca10: How can I create a React styled component
```

GitHub Copilot: To create a styled component in React using Material UI's [`styled`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40mui%2Fmaterial%2Fstyles%2Fstyled.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@mui/material/styles/styled.d.ts") utility, you should follow these steps:

1. **Import the [`styled`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40mui%2Fmaterial%2Fstyles%2Fstyled.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@mui/material/styles/styled.d.ts") utility from `@mui/material`**: This utility allows you to create styled components by defining CSS properties in a template literal.

2. **Define the Styled Component**: Use the [`styled`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40mui%2Fmaterial%2Fstyles%2Fstyled.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@mui/material/styles/styled.d.ts") utility to define your component. You can pass an HTML tag or another component as the first argument, followed by a template literal containing your CSS.

3. **Use the Styled Component in Your React Component**: Once defined, you can use your styled component as a regular React component within your JSX.

Given the excerpt from your active file, it seems there's a slight mistake in the placement of the [`styled`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40mui%2Fmaterial%2Fstyles%2Fstyled.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@mui/material/styles/styled.d.ts") utility usage. The [`styled`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40mui%2Fmaterial%2Fstyles%2Fstyled.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@mui/material/styles/styled.d.ts") utility call should be outside of the [`App`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/App.tsx") component definition to properly define the `RootContent` styled component.

Here's how you can correct and use it:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import NavigationBar from './components/NavigationBar';
import ApplicantForm from './components/ApplicantForm';
import { styled } from '@mui/material';

// Define the styled component outside of the App component
const RootContent = styled('div')`
  display: flex;
`;

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <RootContent>
        <NavigationBar />
        <Routes>
          {/* <Route path="/" element={} /> */}
          <Route path="/add-applicant" element={<ApplicantForm />} />
        </Routes>
      </RootContent>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this corrected version, `RootContent` is a styled component that applies `display: flex;` to a `div` element. You can now use `RootContent` just like any other React component in your JSX. This approach allows you to encapsulate and reuse your styling across different parts of your application.

sjaca10: Create an ApplicantDashboard component with a button "Add Applicant" when clicked shows the ApplicantForm component
```

GitHub Copilot: To create an `ApplicantDashboard` component with a "Add Applicant" button that, when clicked, shows the [`ApplicantForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/ApplicantForm.tsx") component, follow these steps:

1. **Create State to Control Visibility**: Use React's `useState` hook to manage the visibility of the [`ApplicantForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/ApplicantForm.tsx") component.
2. **Button Click Handler**: Implement a function that toggles the visibility state of the [`ApplicantForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/ApplicantForm.tsx").
3. **Conditional Rendering**: Use the visibility state to conditionally render the [`ApplicantForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/ApplicantForm.tsx") component.
4. **Integrate with App Component**: Import and use `ApplicantDashboard` in your [`App`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/App.tsx") component or wherever appropriate.

Here's how you can implement the `ApplicantDashboard` component:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Button } from '@mui/material';
import ApplicantForm from './ApplicantForm';

function ApplicantDashboard() {
  const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(false);

  const toggleFormVisibility = () => setShowForm(!showForm);

  return (
    <div>
      <Button variant="contained" onClick={toggleFormVisibility}>
        Add Applicant
      </Button>
      {showForm && <ApplicantForm />}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ApplicantDashboard;
```

To integrate the `ApplicantDashboard` component into your application, you can modify the `App` component to include it. Assuming you want the dashboard to be the main page, you can adjust the `App` component like this:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import NavigationBar from './components/NavigationBar';
import ApplicantDashboard from './components/ApplicantDashboard';
import { styled } from '@mui/material';

const RootContent = styled('div')`
  display: flex;
`;

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <NavigationBar />
      <RootContent>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<ApplicantDashboard />} />
          {/* Add other routes here */}
        </Routes>
      </RootContent>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This setup allows you to navigate to the `ApplicantDashboard` component from the root URL, where you can click the "Add Applicant" button to display the [`ApplicantForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApplicantForm.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/ApplicantForm.tsx") component.

sjaca10: How to fix "Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3010/applicant' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled."
```

GitHub Copilot: To fix the CORS policy error, you have two main approaches:

### 1. Backend Solution (Recommended)

Modify the server's response headers to include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. This is the most common and recommended approach as it allows you to control which origins are allowed to access your resources.

#### For Node.js/Express:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

// Enable CORS for all routes and origins
app.use(cors());

// Or, enable CORS for specific route and origin
app.use('/applicant', cors({origin: 'http://localhost:3000'}), (req, res) => {
  // Your route code here
});

app.listen(3010, () => console.log('Server running on port 3010'));
```

### 2. Frontend Solution

Set the request's mode to `'no-cors'`. This approach is generally not recommended because it leads to an "opaque" response, which limits the ability to read the response from JavaScript. It's typically used for "send-and-forget" requests.

#### Modifying the `ky.post` call:

```tsx
const response = await ky.post('http://localhost:3010/applicant', {
  json: values,
  mode: 'no-cors' // Not recommended for most use cases
});
```

### Recommended Approach

The best practice is to handle CORS on the server side. This allows you to maintain security while specifying which origins can access your resources. The frontend solution should only be used in specific scenarios where you don't need to read the response or for debugging purposes.
