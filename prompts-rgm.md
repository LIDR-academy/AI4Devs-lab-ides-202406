# Prompts

Primero utilizaré Claude para definir los 3 tickets de trabajo

## Prompt 1

Traduce el texto que adjunto de una historia de usuario a inglés

## Answer

Here's the translation of the user story into English:

Add Candidate to System

As a recruiter, I want to have the ability to add candidates to the ATS system, So that I can efficiently manage their data and selection processes.

Acceptance Criteria:

Function accessibility: There should be a clearly visible button or link to add a new candidate from the recruiter's dashboard main page.
Data entry form: When selecting the option to add a candidate, a form should be presented that includes the necessary fields to capture the candidate's information such as name, surname, email, phone, address, education, and work experience.
Data validation: The form should validate the entered data to ensure it is complete and correct. For example, the email should have a valid format and mandatory fields should not be empty.
Document upload: The recruiter should have the option to upload the candidate's CV in PDF or DOCX format.
Addition confirmation: Once the form is completed and the information is submitted, a confirmation message should appear indicating that the candidate has been successfully added to the system.
Errors and exception handling: In case of an error (for example, failure to connect to the server), the system should display an appropriate message to inform the user of the problem.
Accessibility and compatibility: The functionality should be accessible and compatible with different devices and web browsers.
Notes:

The interface should be intuitive and easy to use to minimize the training time required for new recruiters.
Consider the possibility of integrating autocomplete functionalities for the education and work experience fields, based on pre-existing data in the system.
Technical Tasks:

Implement the user interface for the add candidate form.
Develop the necessary backend to process the information entered in the form.
Ensure the security and privacy of the candidate's data.

## Prompt 2

Given the translated user story attached that is part of an ATS system, define the first technical ticket

## Answer

Certainly. Based on the translated user story for adding a candidate to the ATS system, here's a definition for the first technical ticket:

[add-candidate-ui-ticket](/tickets/add-candidate-ui-ticket.md)

Technical Ticket: Implement Add Candidate UIClick to open document
This ticket focuses on implementing the user interface for adding a candidate, which is a crucial part of the user story. It covers the design and implementation of the form, including all necessary fields, validation, and user feedback mechanisms.
The ticket is detailed enough to guide a developer through the implementation process while leaving room for technical decisions and potential iterations. It also considers important aspects like accessibility and responsiveness, which were mentioned in the user story.
Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this ticket or create additional tickets for other aspects of the user story?

## Prompt 3

ok, now create the other two technical tasks

## Answer

Certainly. I'll create technical tickets for the two remaining tasks mentioned in the user story: developing the backend for processing the form data, and ensuring data security and privacy. Let's start with the backend development ticket.
[process-candidate-data-backend-ticket](/tickets/process-candidate-data-backend-ticket.md)
Now, let's create a ticket for ensuring data security and privacy:
[ensure-candidate-data-security-ticket](/tickets/ensure-candidate-data-security-ticket.md)
These two additional tickets cover the remaining technical tasks mentioned in the user story. The first ticket focuses on developing the backend necessary to process the information entered in the form, while the second ticket addresses the security and privacy concerns for the candidate data.
Together with the UI implementation ticket, these three tickets provide a comprehensive approach to implementing the "Add Candidate" feature in the ATS system, ensuring that all aspects of the user story are addressed.
Would you like me to elaborate on any part of these tickets or provide any additional information?

## Copilot prompts

The conversation was long, with a lot of problems. It took me a while but finally it worked. Here is all the github copilot chat:

rgarciademarina: hello

GitHub Copilot: Hello! How can I assist you today?

rgarciademarina: @workspace We are doing an ats system. Please, generate all the necessary code for the first ticket "add-candidate-ui-ticket.md". For that use the already existing technologies in the project and if you consider we should use a new one please ask for confirmation explainning the reason why. 
Use best practises for the backend and the frontend.
I need all the detailed instructions beside the code itself.

Workspace: Given the project structure and the details provided in the "add-candidate-ui-ticket.md", we'll proceed with implementing the "Add Candidate" user interface in React, as the frontend is already using React based on the [`frontend/README.md`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/README.md"). We'll also ensure to follow best practices for both frontend and backend development. The backend will be implemented in Express with TypeScript, as indicated by the project structure and the [`README.md`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/README.md").

### Frontend Implementation

1. **Add Candidate Button on Dashboard**

   In your React dashboard component, add a button that opens the form modal or navigates to the form page.

   ```jsx
   // frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx
   <button onClick={this.openAddCandidateForm}>Add Candidate</button>
   ```

2. **Form Component**

   Create a new React component for the form. Use controlled components for form fields and manage the state for validation.

   ```jsx
   // frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx
   import React, { useState } from 'react';

   const AddCandidateForm = () => {
     const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
       firstName: '',
       lastName: '',
       email: '',
       phoneNumber: '',
       address: '',
       education: '',
       workExperience: '',
       cv: null,
     });
     const [formErrors, setFormErrors] = useState({});

     // Form validation and submission logic here

     return (
       <form>
         {/* Form fields here */}
         <button type="submit">Submit</button>
       </form>
     );
   };

   export default AddCandidateForm;
   ```

3. **Validation and Submission**

   Implement client-side validation for required fields and email format. Use the HTML5 `pattern` attribute for simple validations and JavaScript for more complex ones.

4. **File Upload Component**

   For the CV upload, use an `<input type="file" />` and restrict file types to PDF and DOCX.

5. **Responsive Design**

   Use CSS or a CSS framework compatible with React to ensure the form is responsive. Follow the project's UI/UX guidelines.

### Backend Implementation

1. **API Endpoint for Form Submission**

   Implement an Express route to handle form submission. Ensure it accepts the required fields and saves the candidate information.

   ```typescript
   // backend/src/index.ts
   app.post('/api/candidates', (req, res) => {
     // Validate and process request data
   });
   ```

2. **Prisma Schema**

   Update the Prisma schema to include a model for candidates if not already present.

   ```prisma
   // backend/prisma/schema.prisma
   model Candidate {
     id            Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
     firstName     String
     lastName      String
     email         String
     phoneNumber   String?
     address       String?
     education     String?
     workExperience String?
     cv            String? // Path to CV file or similar
   }
   ```

   - Access the application in a web browser to test the "Add Candidate" functionality manually.

This implementation guide assumes the use of React for the frontend and Express with TypeScript for the backend, following the technologies already present in the project. If there's a need to introduce a new technology, please provide more details on the requirements for further assistance.

rgarciademarina: @workspace Give me the code for the step 3 of the frontend implementation

Workspace: To implement the Express route for handling candidate submissions as mentioned in step 3 of the frontend implementation guide in [`prompts-rgm.md`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fprompts-rgm.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/prompts-rgm.md"), you would typically do this in the backend, not the frontend. However, since the guide mentions implementing this route, I'll provide an example of how you might do it in an Express application in the backend. This code assumes you have Express and body-parser installed and set up in your [`backend`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend") project.

```javascript
// backend/src/index.ts

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware to parse JSON bodies
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Route for handling candidate submissions
app.post('/submit-candidate', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Assuming you have a function to process candidate data
    // This could involve saving the data to a database
    // For example: await saveCandidate(req.body);
    console.log('Received candidate submission:', req.body);
    res.status(200).send({ message: 'Candidate submitted successfully' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error submitting candidate:', error);
    res.status(500).send({ message: 'Error submitting candidate' });
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

This code snippet creates an Express server that listens for POST requests on the `/submit-candidate` route. It uses `body-parser` middleware to parse JSON request bodies, allowing you to access the submission data through `req.body`. The route handler logs the received data and sends a success response. In a real application, you would replace the logging with actual logic to process and store the candidate data, such as saving it to a database.

Remember, this code is for the backend. The frontend implementation would involve creating a form and using a method (e.g., fetch API, Axios) to send the form data to this backend endpoint when the form is submitted.

rgarciademarina: @workspace Please, apply what you just told me to the already existing file index.ts and if we need to add body-parser to the project, explain how

Workspace: To apply the necessary changes to the [`index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/src/index.ts") file for processing request data in the `/api/candidates` endpoint, you'll need to parse the incoming request bodies. Express has built-in middleware for this purpose, so you don't need to add `body-parser` as it was a separate package required in older versions of Express. Since Express 4.16.0 and later, the functionality to parse incoming request bodies is included in Express itself.

Here's how you can modify the [`index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/src/index.ts") file to include body parsing middleware and a basic implementation for processing candidate data:

```typescript
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
import express from 'express';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export const app = express();
export default prisma;

const port = 3010;

// Use Express built-in middleware for parsing JSON request bodies
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hola LTI!');
});

// Updated POST handler to process request data
app.post('/api/candidates', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Example: Validate and process request data here
    const { name, email } = req.body; // Assuming the body contains 'name' and 'email'
    if (!name || !email) {
      return res.status(400).send('Missing name or email');
    }

    // Example: Save the candidate using Prisma
    const candidate = await prisma.candidate.create({
      data: {
        name,
        email,
      },
    });

    res.status(201).json(candidate);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  }
});

app.use((err: any, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.type('text/plain'); 
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This code snippet includes the use of `express.json()` middleware to parse JSON request bodies, and an updated `/api/candidates` endpoint that demonstrates how to access the parsed data from `req.body`. Note that the example assumes you have a `candidate` model defined in your Prisma schema and that the `create` method is used to save the candidate data to your database. You'll need to adjust this according to your actual database schema and requirements.

Since the functionality for parsing request bodies is already included in Express, there's no need to add `body-parser` to your project.

rgarciademarina: @workspace ok now explain how to do the step 4. File Upload Component for the frontend

Workspace: To implement a file upload component for the frontend, specifically within the context of the [`AddCandidateForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") component in the [`frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") file, you can follow these steps. This will allow users to upload a CV or any other relevant document as part of their candidate information.

1. **Update the Form State to Include File Data**: You already have a [`formData`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") state that includes a [`cv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") field initialized to `null`. This is where the uploaded file's data will be stored.

2. **Create an Input Field for File Upload**: Add an input field of type `file` to your form. This input will allow users to select the file they wish to upload.

3. **Handle File Selection**: Implement an `onChange` event handler for the file input field. This handler should update the [`formData`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") state with the selected file.

4. **Modify the Submission Logic to Include File Data**: When the form is submitted, ensure that the file data is included. Since files cannot be sent as JSON, you'll need to use `FormData` to construct the payload for your POST request.

Here's how you can modify the [`AddCandidateForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") component to include these steps:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const AddCandidateForm = () => {
    const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
        firstName: '',
        lastName: '',
        email: '',
        phoneNumber: '',
        address: '',
        education: '',
        workExperience: '',
        cv: null, // Placeholder for the file
    });
    const [formErrors, setFormErrors] = useState({});

    const handleFileChange = (e) => {
        setFormData({ ...formData, cv: e.target.files[0] });
    };

    const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();

        // Construct FormData for file upload
        const formPayload = new FormData();
        for (const key in formData) {
            formPayload.append(key, formData[key]);
        }

        // Example POST request with formPayload
        try {
            const response = await fetch('/api/candidates', {
                method: 'POST',
                body: formPayload, // FormData object
                // Note: When using FormData, the 'Content-Type' header should not be set manually
                // as the browser will set it to 'multipart/form-data' with the correct boundary
            });
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
            }
            // Handle success
            console.log('Form submitted successfully');
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error submitting form:', error);
            // Handle error
        }
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            {/* Other form fields */}
            <input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange} />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
};

export default AddCandidateForm;
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to add a file input to the form, handle file selection, and modify the form submission logic to include the file in the request payload. Remember to adjust the form fields and the API endpoint (`/api/candidates`) as necessary to match your application's requirements.

rgarciademarina: @workspace ok, give me the code for adjusting the form fields and the API endpoint as you just told me

Workspace: To adjust the form fields and the API endpoint in the `AddCandidateForm` component to include file data in the submission, you can follow these steps. This involves modifying the existing form to include a file input and adjusting the form submission logic to use `FormData` for sending the request, including the file data. The API endpoint will be set to `/api/candidates` as mentioned.

Here's an example of how you might adjust the `AddCandidateForm` component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const AddCandidateForm = () => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: '',
    email: '',
    resume: null, // Added for file
  });
  const [formErrors, setFormErrors] = useState({});

  const handleInputChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setFormData({ ...formData, [name]: value });
  };

  const handleFileChange = (e) => {
    setFormData({ ...formData, resume: e.target.files[0] });
  };

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    // Validation logic here

    const data = new FormData();
    data.append('name', formData.name);
    data.append('email', formData.email);
    data.append('resume', formData.resume);

    try {
      const response = await axios.post('/api/candidates', data, {
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
        },
      });
      console.log(response.data);
      // Handle success
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      // Handle error
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        type="text"
        name="name"
        value={formData.name}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
        placeholder="Name"
      />
      <input
        type="email"
        name="email"
        value={formData.email}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
        placeholder="Email"
      />
      <input
        type="file"
        name="resume"
        onChange={handleFileChange}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default AddCandidateForm;
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to add a file input for the resume, handle changes to the file input, and modify the form submission logic to include the file in the request payload using `FormData`. Remember to adjust the form fields and the API endpoint (`/api/candidates`) as necessary to match your application's requirements.

rgarciademarina: @workspace Please, give me the code for implemented the step "5. Responsive Design"

Workspace: I'm sorry, I can't answer that question with what I currently know about your workspace.

rgarciademarina: @workspace You told me before, as a part of the Frontend Implementation, in the step "5. Responsive Design" "Use CSS or a CSS framework compatible with React to ensure the form is responsive. Follow the project's UI/UX guidelines.". Please, give me the code changes needed to do that

Given the structure of your workspace and the existing CSS setup in [`frontend/src/App.css`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2FApp.css%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/App.css") and [`frontend/src/index.css`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Findex.css%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/index.css"), I'll provide an example of how you might adjust the CSS for [`AddCandidateForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") to be responsive. This will involve adding some custom CSS for the form and utilizing media queries to adjust the layout based on the screen size.

First, ensure you have a CSS file for the [`AddCandidateForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") component. If not, create one named [`AddCandidateForm.css`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") in the same directory as your [`AddCandidateForm.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") component.

**frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.css**:
```css
.form-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 20px;
}

.form-field {
  margin: 10px 0;
  width: 80%;
  max-width: 500px; /* Ensures the form does not stretch too wide on larger screens */
}

.form-button {
  margin-top: 20px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

/* Responsive adjustments */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .form-field {
    width: 90%;
  }
}
```

Next, ensure your `AddCandidateForm.jsx` component imports this CSS file:

**frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx**:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import './AddCandidateForm.css'; // Import the CSS file here

const AddCandidateForm = () => {
  // Component logic remains the same
  // ...

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="form-container">
      <input
        type="text"
        name="name"
        value={formData.name}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
        placeholder="Name"
        className="form-field"
      />
      <input
        type="email"
        name="email"
        value={formData.email}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
        placeholder="Email"
        className="form-field"
      />
      <input
        type="file"
        name="resume"
        onChange={handleFileChange}
        className="form-field"
      />
      <button type="submit" className="form-button">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default AddCandidateForm;
```

These changes introduce a basic responsive design for the [`AddCandidateForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") component, ensuring it adapts to different screen sizes. The CSS rules adjust the width of the form fields on smaller screens. Remember to follow your project's UI/UX guidelines closely and adjust the CSS as needed to match your design system.

rgarciademarina: @workspace change the frontend index.tsx file to show the Dashboard components instead of the logo render

Workspace: To show the Dashboard component instead of the logo render in the [`frontend/src/index.tsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/index.tsx") file, you need to import the Dashboard component and use it within the [`root.render`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/index.tsx") method. Here's how you can modify the [`frontend/src/index.tsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/index.tsx") file:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
// Import Dashboard component instead of App
import Dashboard from './components/Dashboard';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
);
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Dashboard /> {/* Use Dashboard component here */}
  </React.StrictMode>
);

reportWebVitals();
```

Make sure that the import path for the Dashboard component is correct according to your project structure. In this case, it's assumed that the Dashboard component is located at `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` as per the workspace structure you provided.

rgarciademarina: when executing npm run build at the frontend directory I get the following error:
raul@RG701701 frontend % npm run build

> frontend@0.1.0 build
> react-scripts build

Creating an optimized production build...
One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.
  
Failed to compile.

Attempted import error: './components/Dashboard' does not contain a default export (imported as 'Dashboard').

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're encountering indicates two separate issues:

1. **Dependency Warning**: The warning about `babel-preset-react-app` and `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object` suggests adding `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object` to your `devDependencies` to ensure stability. This is a workaround due to the dependency not being maintained actively.

2. **Import Error**: The error stating that `'./components/Dashboard' does not contain a default export` means that the [`Dashboard`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/index.tsx") component is not exported as a default export in its file, but you are trying to import it as one.

To resolve these issues, follow these steps:

### Fixing the Dependency Warning

1. **Add `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object` to `devDependencies`**:
   - Run the following command in your terminal within the [`frontend`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend") directory:
     ```bash
     npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object --save-dev
     ```

### Fixing the Import Error

2. **Correct the Import Statement for the `Dashboard` Component**:
   - You need to check how `Dashboard` is exported in its file (`./components/Dashboard`). If it's a named export, you'll need to adjust the import statement accordingly.
   - If `Dashboard` is exported like this:
     ```tsx
     export class Dashboard extends React.Component { ... }
     ```
     or
     ```tsx
     export const Dashboard = () => { ... }
     ```
     Then you need to import it using curly braces:
     ```tsx
     import { Dashboard } from './components/Dashboard';
     ```
   - If you want to keep using `Dashboard` as a default import, ensure it's exported as default in its file:
     ```tsx
     export default Dashboard;
     ```

After making these changes, try running `npm run build` again.

rgarciademarina: @workspace after executing npm start and openning localhost:3000 in chrome, I just see a white screen. The expected button isn't shown.

Workspace: Given the information provided, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue of seeing a white screen instead of the expected content when you open `localhost:3000` in Chrome after executing [`npm start`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/README.md") for your React application:

1. **Check the Console for Errors:**
   Open the Chrome Developer Tools by pressing `F12` or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect", then go to the "Console" tab. Look for any error messages that might indicate what's going wrong.

2. **Verify the Root Element:**
   Ensure that the [`index.html`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fpublic%2Findex.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/public/index.html") file in your `public` folder has a div with an id of "root", as this is where your React app is attempting to render the [`Dashboard`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx") component. The relevant part of your [`index.html`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fpublic%2Findex.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/public/index.html") should look like this:
   ```html
   <div id="root"></div>
   ```
   This matches the target element in your [`index.tsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/index.tsx") file:
   ```tsx
   document.getElementById('root')
   ```

3. **Check the Dashboard Component:**
   Since your `index.tsx` is trying to render the `Dashboard` component, ensure that this component is correctly implemented and exported in [frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx](frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx). Any errors or issues within the `Dashboard` component could prevent it from rendering correctly.

4. **Review Import Paths:**
   Ensure that the import path for the `Dashboard` component in your `index.tsx` file is correct. The import statement you provided seems correct, but it's worth double-checking:
   ```tsx
   import { Dashboard } from './components/Dashboard';
   ```

5. **Check for Missing Dependencies:**
   If the [`Dashboard`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx") component or any other part of your application relies on external dependencies, make sure all necessary packages are installed. You can run `npm install` in the [`frontend`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend") directory to ensure all dependencies listed in your [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/package.json") are installed.

6. **Review Error Boundaries:**
   If your application uses error boundaries, ensure they are correctly implemented. An error within the [`Dashboard`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx") component might be caught by an error boundary, which could result in rendering fallback UI instead of the expected content.

7. **Network Issues:**
   Ensure there are no network issues that might prevent the loading of necessary scripts or resources. You can check the "Network" tab in Chrome Developer Tools for any failed requests.

If after these steps the issue persists, you might want to consider creating a minimal reproducible example of the [`Dashboard`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx") component and testing it in isolation to ensure it renders as expected.

GitHub Copilot: The error messages you're encountering are due to two separate issues in your React application.

1. **ReactDOM.render Warning**: This warning is because React 18 introduced a new root API. To resolve this, you need to modify the way your application is initialized to use `createRoot` instead of `ReactDOM.render`. This change is necessary to leverage the new features and improvements in React 18.

2. **Uncaught TypeError**: The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'openAddCandidateForm')` suggests that `this.openAddCandidateForm` is being called in a functional component ([`Dashboard`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx")), where `this` is not defined. In functional components, you don't have access to `this`. If `openAddCandidateForm` is a function that needs to be called when the button is clicked, you should define it inside the component or pass it as a prop.

Here's how you can address both issues:

### Fixing ReactDOM.render Warning

First, ensure you're using React 18 and then modify the entry point of your application. Assuming your entry file is `index.js`, here's how you can update it:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App'; // Adjust the import path according to your file structure

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Fixing Uncaught TypeError

For the `Dashboard` component, if `openAddCandidateForm` is a standalone function, ensure it's defined within the component or passed as a prop. Here's an example assuming it's defined within the component:

```jsx
export const Dashboard = () => {
  const openAddCandidateForm = () => {
    // Implementation of what happens when the button is clicked
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={openAddCandidateForm}>Add Candidate</button>
  );
};
```

Make these changes according to your application's specific setup and requirements.

rgarciademarina: @workspace for the warning it is not a js file but a tsx file, adapt it

Workspace: To adapt the warning for a TypeScript React file (`.tsx`), you can modify the comment to reflect the correct file type and include TypeScript-specific advice if necessary. Here's how you might adjust the comment in the [`frontend/public/index.html`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fpublic%2Findex.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/public/index.html") file:

```html
<!--
  This HTML file is a template.
  If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.
  
  You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
  The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.
  
  To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
  To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
  
  Note: If you are working with TypeScript React (.tsx files), ensure your TypeScript configuration is correctly set up to compile JSX syntax.
-->
```

This comment provides a general reminder that when working with TypeScript in a React project, the TypeScript compiler's configuration (`tsconfig.json`) needs to support JSX syntax. This is typically done by setting `"jsx": "react"` in the `tsconfig.json` file, which is already likely configured in a Create React App project.

Here's how you can implement the `openAddCandidateForm` function along with the necessary state modifications in the [`Dashboard`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx") component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { AddCandidateForm } from './AddCandidateForm'; // Ensure this import is correct

export const Dashboard = () => {
  const [isFormOpen, setIsFormOpen] = useState(false);

  const openAddCandidateForm = () => setIsFormOpen(true);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={openAddCandidateForm}>Add Candidate</button>
      {isFormOpen && <AddCandidateForm />}
    </>
  );
};
```

This code snippet modifies the [`Dashboard`](frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx) component to include a state `isFormOpen` that controls the visibility of the `AddCandidateForm`. When the "Add Candidate" button is clicked, `openAddCandidateForm` is called, setting `isFormOpen` to `true`, which in turn renders the `AddCandidateForm` component.

To resolve these issues, follow these steps:

### Fixing Axios Module Not Found Error

You need to ensure that [`axios`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") is installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal in the [`frontend`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend") directory:

```sh
npm install axios
```

Or if you're using `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add axios
```

### Fixing Incorrect Import in [`Dashboard.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx")

You should change the import statement in your [`Dashboard.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FDashboard.jsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx") file to use the default import syntax since [`AddCandidateForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") is exported as a default export. Modify the import statement from:

```jsx
import { AddCandidateForm } from './AddCandidateForm';
```

to:

```jsx
import AddCandidateForm from './AddCandidateForm';
```

After making these changes, your issues should be resolved.

I see that is trying to use the port 3000, however the backend is running at the port 3010, how should I fix it?

Workspace: To fix the issue where the frontend is trying to submit a candidate to the wrong port, you need to update the [`axios.post`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fnode_modules%2Faxios%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A559%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "node_modules/axios/index.d.ts") URL in the [`AddCandidateForm.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") to use the correct port (`3010`) where your backend is running. You can do this by specifying the full URL including the correct port number in the [`axios.post`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fnode_modules%2Faxios%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A559%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "node_modules/axios/index.d.ts") call.

Here's how you can update the [`axios.post`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fnode_modules%2Faxios%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A559%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "node_modules/axios/index.d.ts") call in your [`AddCandidateForm.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx"):

```jsx
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  // Validation logic here

  const data = new FormData();
  data.append('name', formData.name);
  data.append('email', formData.email);
  data.append('resume', formData.resume);

  try {
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:3010/api/candidates', data, {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
      },
    });
    console.log(response.data);
    // Handle success
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

This change specifies the correct port (`3010`) in the URL, ensuring that the request is sent to the correct backend endpoint.

You can find the `AddCandidateForm.jsx` file here: [frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx](frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx).

Workspace: The error you're encountering, `POST http://localhost:3010/api/candidates net::ERR_FAILED 400 (Bad Request)`, indicates that the server is rejecting the request due to a client-side error. Given the code excerpts and the structure of your workspace, there are a few potential reasons for this error:

1. **Validation Failure on the Backend**: The backend code in [`backend/src/index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/src/index.ts") checks if both [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") and [`email`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") are provided in the request body. If either of these is missing or empty, it returns a 400 status with the message 'Missing name or email'. Ensure that both [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") and [`email`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") fields are filled out in the form before submitting.

2. **Incorrect Content-Type Header**: The frontend code in [`frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") sets the [`Content-Type`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fnode_modules%2Faxios%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A86%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "node_modules/axios/index.d.ts") header to `'multipart/form-data'` but does not specify the boundary. This is usually handled automatically by the browser when a [`FormData`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FApplications%2FVisual%2520Studio%2520Code.app%2FContents%2FResources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.dom.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FApplications%2FVisual%20Studio%20Code.app%2FContents%2FResources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.dom.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A8737%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.dom.d.ts") object is used, but if there's any misconfiguration or if the server expects a specific format, it could cause issues. However, this is less likely the issue since your backend doesn't explicitly validate the [`Content-Type`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fnode_modules%2Faxios%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A86%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "node_modules/axios/index.d.ts") header beyond expecting a multipart form data.

3. **File Upload Handling**: If the backend is not correctly configured to handle file uploads or if there's an issue with the file being uploaded (e.g., size limit, file type restrictions), it could lead to a 400 error. However, from the provided backend code, it seems like file handling isn't explicitly implemented yet beyond expecting a file in the request.

To debug this issue:

- **Check the Form Data**: Ensure that both the [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") and [`email`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") fields are correctly filled out in the form. You can add client-side validation to provide immediate feedback to the user if these fields are empty.
- **Inspect the Network Request**: Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the network request being made. Check the request payload to ensure that the [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts"), [`email`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts"), and [`resume`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") fields are correctly included in the request.
- **Review Backend Logs**: Check the server logs for any additional information about why the request was rejected. The backend might log more details about the validation failure or other issues encountered while processing the request.

If the issue persists after these checks, you may need to review the backend's file handling logic to ensure it's correctly set up to receive and process file uploads, as well as validate and store the incoming data as per the requirements outlined in the [`tickets/process-candidate-data-backend-ticket.md`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ftickets%2Fprocess-candidate-data-backend-ticket.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/tickets/process-candidate-data-backend-ticket.md").

rgarciademarina: @workspace how can I check the backend logs?

Workspace: To check the backend logs, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Run the Backend in Development Mode**: Use the `dev` script defined in the [`backend/package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/package.json") file. This script uses `ts-node-dev` which automatically restarts the server on file changes and can print runtime logs to the console.

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

2. **Check the Console Output**: When running the backend in development mode, any logs (such as console.log statements in your TypeScript files) will be printed directly to the terminal where you ran the `npm run dev` command.

3. **Logging Framework**: If your application uses a logging framework (e.g., Winston, Morgan for HTTP requests in Express apps), ensure it's configured to output logs to the console or to a file. The current workspace information does not specify a logging framework, so you might want to consider adding one if detailed logging is necessary.

4. **Docker Logs**: If you're running your backend inside a Docker container (as suggested by the presence of a [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file), you can view the logs of the container using the following command:

    ```sh
    docker-compose logs <service-name>
    ```

    Replace `<service-name>` with the name of your backend service as defined in your [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/docker-compose.yml").

5. **External Logging Services**: If your application is deployed and uses external logging services (like ELK stack, Splunk, or cloud provider logging services), check their respective documentation on how to access the logs.

Remember, the method to check logs can vary based on your application's configuration and the environment it's running in (development, staging, production).

rgarciademarina: @workspace In my backend application I don't see any logs at the terminal, even if it is responding to the frontend with status code 400, how could I fix that?

Workspace: To add logging for requests that result in a status code 400, you can modify your backend application to include middleware that logs such requests. Since your application is using Express, you can create a custom middleware function that checks the response status code and logs the request and response details if the status code is 400. Here's how you could implement it in your [`backend/src/index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/src/index.ts") file:

```ts
// Custom middleware for logging requests with status code 400
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const originalSend = res.send;
  res.send = function(body) {
    if (res.statusCode === 400) {
      console.log(`Logging 400 response: ${req.method} ${req.url} - Body: ${body}`);
    }
    return originalSend.apply(this, arguments);
  };
  next();
});

// Make sure to place this middleware before your routes
```

This middleware function intercepts the `send` method of the response object. It checks if the response status code is 400 and logs the request method, URL, and response body. Ensure you place this middleware before your route definitions so it can properly intercept and log the requests resulting in a 400 status code.

You can adjust the logging details according to your needs, such as including more request information or formatting the log output differently.

Remember to add this middleware in the correct place in your [`backend/src/index.ts`](backend/src/index.ts) file, ideally right after you set up other middleware but before defining your routes, to ensure it captures all relevant requests.

rgarciademarina: @workspace it seems that the backend is not recovering the name or the email from the request body and is returning status code 400. However the frontend seems to be sending both the email and the name, what could be wront?

Workspace: Given the provided code excerpts, the issue likely stems from how the backend handles the incoming request data. The frontend is sending the data as `multipart/form-data` due to the inclusion of a file upload in the form. This is evident from the [`headers`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fbuild%2Fstatic%2Fjs%2Fmain.fcf8ee79.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fbuild%2Fstatic%2Fjs%2Fmain.fcf8ee79.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fbuild%2Fstatic%2Fjs%2Fmain.fcf8ee79.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A155686%7D%5D "frontend/build/static/js/main.fcf8ee79.js") configuration in the [`axios.post`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fnode_modules%2Faxios%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A559%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "node_modules/axios/index.d.ts") call within the [`frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") file:

```jsx
const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:3010/api/candidates', data, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
  },
});
```

However, the backend excerpt from [`backend/src/index.ts`](backend/src/index.ts) does not show any middleware configured to parse `multipart/form-data` requests. Express does not handle `multipart/form-data` by default. You need to use additional middleware like `multer` to parse these types of requests.

To fix the issue, you can install `multer` and use it in your route to handle `multipart/form-data`:

1. Install `multer`:

```sh
npm install multer
```

2. Use `multer` in your `/api/candidates` route:

```typescript
import multer from 'multer';

const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' }); // Configure multer, setting uploads directory

// Updated POST handler to process multipart/form-data
app.post('/api/candidates', upload.single('resume'), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { name, email } = req.body; // Now multer parses 'name' and 'email'
    if (!name || !email) {
      return res.status(400).send('Missing name or email');
    }

    // Proceed with your existing logic
});
```

By adding `multer` as middleware for the `/api/candidates` route, it will parse the `multipart/form-data` request, making `name` and `email` available in `req.body` and the file uploaded under `resume` available in `req.file`.

This should resolve the issue of the backend not being able to recover the `name` or the `email` from the request body, assuming that the frontend correctly sends both fields.

GitHub Copilot: The issue you're encountering indicates that the environment variables (`DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_USER`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_PORT`) defined in your [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/.env") file are not being recognized by Docker Compose. Additionally, the PostgreSQL container requires a `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable for the superuser, which seems to be missing or not set.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/.env") File is Referenced in [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/docker-compose.yml")**: Make sure your [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/docker-compose.yml") file is configured to use the [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/.env") file for environment variables. You can specify the [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/.env") file at the top level of your [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/docker-compose.yml") like this:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    env_file:
      - .env # This line tells Docker Compose to use variables from .env
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USER}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${DB_NAME}
    ports:
      - "${DB_PORT}:5432"
```

2. **Set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`**: Ensure that the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable is set to use the `DB_PASSWORD` from your `.env` file, as shown in the `docker-compose.yml` snippet above.

3. **Check `.env` File Location**: The `.env` file needs to be in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file or specify the path to it in the `env_file` section if it's located elsewhere.

4. **Verify Environment Variable Names**: Ensure that the environment variable names in the `.env` file match those expected by your Docker Compose and Dockerfile configurations. For PostgreSQL, the official image expects `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_USER`, and `POSTGRES_DB` for initial setup.

5. **Reload Environment Variables**: If you made changes to the `.env` file or `docker-compose.yml`, you might need to stop the running containers and start them again for the changes to take effect. Use `docker compose down` followed by `docker compose up` to restart your services.

By following these steps, Docker Compose should correctly recognize your environment variables, and the PostgreSQL container should start without the initialization error.

Workspace: The warnings and errors you're encountering indicate that the environment variables `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_NAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` are not being correctly passed to Docker Compose. This is crucial for configuring the PostgreSQL container as specified in your [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/docker-compose.yml") file.

Given the information from your workspace, the environment variables are defined in your [`backend/.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/.env") file. However, Docker Compose is not recognizing them. This can happen for a few reasons:

1. **Docker Compose Version**: Ensure you're using a version of Docker Compose that supports the `env_file` configuration. Your [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/docker-compose.yml") uses version '3', which should be compatible, but it's always good to check for updates.

2. **File Path**: The `env_file` path in your [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/docker-compose.yml") is relative to the location from where you run the `docker compose up` command. Make sure you're running the command from the project root directory, where the [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/docker-compose.yml") file is located.

3. **Syntax and Formatting**: Ensure there are no syntax errors in your [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/.env") file and that it's properly formatted. The format should be `VARIABLE=value` without spaces around the `=`.

4. **Docker Compose Command**: You used `docker compose up` in your command. While this should generally work, try using `docker-compose up` (with a hyphen) instead, as some versions and configurations might handle environment variables differently.

5. **Manual Environment Variables**: As a temporary workaround, you can manually specify the environment variables in the terminal before running `docker-compose up`, like so:

```sh
export DB_PORT=5432
export DB_USER=LTIdbUser
export DB_NAME=LTIdb
export DB_PASSWORD=D1ymf8wyQEGthFR1E9xhCq
docker-compose up
```

This approach directly sets the environment variables in your shell session, which Docker Compose can then access.

If you continue to face issues, double-check the `.env` file's location and content, ensuring it matches the details specified in your [`backend/.env`](backend/.env) and [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) files.

Workspace: The error message you're encountering, `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'create')`, suggests that the `create` method is being called on an undefined object. This typically occurs when the object expected to have the `create` method hasn't been properly initialized or is not accessible in the context where it's being used.

In your case, the error is pointing to the line in your [`backend/src/index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/src/index.ts") file where you're trying to create a new candidate using Prisma's `create` method:

```ts
const candidate = await prisma.candidate.create({
  data: {
    name,
    email,
  },
});
```

Given the information, there are a few potential issues to check:

1. **Prisma Model Definition**: Ensure that your Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) defines a model named `candidate`. If the model name is different, you should use the correct model name in the `create` method call.

2. **Prisma Client Initialization**: The error could be due to the Prisma client not being initialized correctly. However, from the provided code excerpt, it seems you are initializing the Prisma client correctly with `const prisma = new PrismaClient();`. Make sure that this line of code is executed before you try to use `prisma`.

3. **Prisma Client Generation**: Ensure that you have run `npx prisma generate` after defining or updating your Prisma schema. This command generates or updates the Prisma client to match your schema, including the `create` method for your models.

4. **Module Export/Import Issues**: Ensure that the file where `prisma` is initialized is correctly imported where it's used. From the provided code, it seems you are using `prisma` in the same file it's initialized, so this is less likely the issue unless you've made changes to the file structure not shown here.

To resolve the issue, verify the above points. If the problem persists, it might be helpful to log the `prisma` object before the `create` call to ensure it's not `undefined` and that the `candidate` model is accessible as expected.

Workspace: The error you're encountering indicates a problem with the database connection string specified in your `.env` file. The error message suggests that the port number in the database URL is invalid. This could be due to a typo, an incorrect port number, or a formatting issue in the connection string.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Check the `.env` File**: Open your `.env` file and locate the `DATABASE_URL` variable. This variable should contain the connection string to your PostgreSQL database.

2. **Correct the Connection String**: Ensure that the connection string is correctly formatted. A typical PostgreSQL connection string looks like this:
   ```
   postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
   ```
   Make sure that:
   - `USER`, `PASSWORD`, `HOST`, `PORT`, and `DATABASE` are correctly replaced with your actual database credentials.
   - The port number is valid and the database server is listening on that port.
   - If any part of your connection string includes special characters, they may need to be URL-encoded.

3. **Restart the Server**: After correcting the connection string, save the `.env` file and restart your server by running `npm run dev` again.

If you continue to face issues, double-check the database credentials and ensure that your database server is running and accessible. Additionally, you can refer to the Prisma documentation on [connection URLs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls) for more detailed information on constructing a correct connection string.

Workspace: The errors you're encountering during the build process in the backend directory are related to TypeScript type mismatches and incorrect argument types. Here's how you can address each error:

1. **Error with `IArguments` not assignable to parameter type `[body?: any]`:**

   This error occurs because TypeScript does not automatically infer the `arguments` object to the expected type. You can resolve this by converting `arguments` to an array which is more flexible in terms of typing. Replace the `arguments` object with the spread syntax to create an array from it.

   In [`backend/src/index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/src/index.ts"), modify the line causing the error as follows:

   ```typescript
   // Original
   return originalSend.apply(this, arguments);

   // Modified
   return originalSend.apply(this, [...arguments]);
   ```

2. **Error with object literal not assignable to expected type:**

   This error suggests that the object you're trying to assign does not match the expected type, specifically mentioning that the property `name` does not exist in the expected type. This could be due to a mismatch in the expected structure of the object or missing/incorrect types.

   Without the exact structure of `CandidateCreateInput` and `CandidateUncheckedCreateInput`, it's hard to provide a precise solution. However, the error points towards an issue with the properties you are trying to use (`name`, `email`) not being recognized in the expected type.

   You should review the definition of `CandidateCreateInput` and `CandidateUncheckedCreateInput` in your Prisma schema or TypeScript types to ensure you're passing the correct properties. If `name` is indeed a valid property, make sure it's correctly defined in your Prisma schema or TypeScript type definitions.

   If `name` and `email` are supposed to be part of the object, ensure they are defined in your Prisma schema under the `Candidate` model. If they are custom fields not directly related to the database model, you might need to adjust your approach to handling them.

For more specific guidance, reviewing the Prisma schema (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`) and the TypeScript type definitions related to your Prisma models would be necessary.

Workspace: The errors you're encountering during the build process in the backend directory are related to TypeScript type checking. Here's how you can address each error:

1. **Error with [`originalSend.apply(this, arguments);`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A18%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts")**

   The TypeScript error TS2345 is because the [`apply`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FApplications%2FVisual%20Studio%20Code.app%2FContents%2FResources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es5.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A342%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "../../../../Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es5.d.ts") method expects an array of arguments, but `arguments` is an `IArguments` object, not an array. To fix this, you can convert `arguments` to an array using the spread syntax.

   Update the line in [`backend/src/index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/src/index.ts") as follows:

   ```ts
   return originalSend.apply(this, [...arguments]);
   ```

2. **Error with `prisma.Candidate.create({`**

   The TypeScript error TS2551 indicates a case sensitivity issue with the Prisma model access. Prisma model names are case-sensitive and should match the model name defined in your Prisma schema exactly. In your `schema.prisma`, the model is defined as `Candidate`, but the correct way to access models in Prisma Client is in lowercase.

   Update the line in [backend/src/index.ts](backend/src/index.ts) to use the lowercase model name:

   ```ts
   const candidate = await prisma.candidate.create({
   ```

After making these changes, try running `npm run build` again in the backend directory. These modifications should resolve the TypeScript errors you're encountering.

Workspace: To address the errors you're encountering during the build process, let's tackle them one by one:

### Error 1 & 2: Argument of type 'any[]' is not assignable & Type 'IArguments' can only be iterated through...

These errors are related to the use of `...arguments` in a TypeScript file. The `arguments` object is not an array, but an array-like object. To resolve these errors, you can enable the `--downlevelIteration` flag or target a higher ECMAScript version that supports downlevel iteration of `arguments`. Since your [`backend/tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/tsconfig.json") already targets `"es5"`, you can enable `downlevelIteration`:

In your [`backend/tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/tsconfig.json"), add the `downlevelIteration` flag under `compilerOptions`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "downlevelIteration": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

### Error 3: Type '{ name: any; email: any; }' is not assignable...

This error suggests that the properties you're trying to use (`name` and `email`) do not exist in the expected type for the `data` property when creating a candidate. It's likely that the `CandidateCreateInput` type expects different property names or additional properties.

To resolve this, you need to ensure that the object you're passing to `prisma.candidate.create` matches the expected `CandidateCreateInput` type. Check your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to see the exact definition of `Candidate` and adjust the object accordingly. For example, if the `Candidate` model expects `firstName` and `emailAddress` instead of `name` and `email`, you would adjust the code like this:

```typescript
const candidate = await prisma.candidate.create({
  data: {
    firstName: name, // Assuming 'name' should map to 'firstName'
    emailAddress: email, // Assuming 'email' should map to 'emailAddress'
    // Add any other required fields here
  },
});
```

Make sure to replace `firstName` and `emailAddress` with the actual field names expected by your `Candidate` model in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts").

Found 2 errors in the same file, starting at: src/index.ts:24


Workspace: To resolve the errors you're encountering when running `npm run build` in the backend directory, you'll need to address two separate issues in your [`src/index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/src/index.ts") file.

### Error 1: Argument of type 'any[]' is not assignable to parameter of type '[body?: any]'.

This error occurs at this line:

```ts
return originalSend.apply(this, [...arguments]);
```

The `apply` method expects an array of arguments where the length and types of the array are known. However, `arguments` is an array-like object that doesn't strictly match the expected type. To fix this, you can spread `arguments` into an array but ensure it matches the expected type signature by only including the first argument if it exists:

```ts
return originalSend.apply(this, arguments.length ? [arguments[0]] : []);
```

### Error 2: Type '{ firstName: any; email: any; }' is not assignable to type...

This error is due to the Prisma schema expecting a `lastName` field when creating a `Candidate`, but it's missing in the object passed to [`prisma.candidate.create`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts"). To resolve this, you need to include the `lastName` field in the data object. Assuming you have `lastName` in your request body, you can modify the code as follows:

```ts
const { name, email, lastName } = req.body; // Assuming lastName is also part of the request
if (!name || !email || !lastName) {
  return res.status(400).send('Missing name, email, or lastName');
}

const candidate = await prisma.candidate.create({
  data: {
    firstName: name,
    lastName, // Add this line
    email,
  },
});
```

Make sure to adjust the destructuring of `req.body` and the validation check to include any other required fields based on your application's requirements and your Prisma schema definition.

After making these changes, try running `npm run build` again.

  meta: { modelName: 'Candidate', table: 'public.Candidate' }

Workspace: The error you're encountering indicates that the `Candidate` table does not exist in your database. This can happen if the database schema has not been applied correctly or at all. To resolve this issue, you need to run the Prisma migrations to create the `Candidate` table in your database. You can do this by executing the following commands in your terminal from the [`backend`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend") directory:

1. Generate the Prisma client and any necessary migrations with:
   ```sh
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
   This command will create a new migration file (if your schema has changed) and apply the migration to your database, creating the `Candidate` table.

2. After running the migration, you can verify that the `Candidate` table has been created in your database. Optionally, you can also run:
   ```sh
   npx prisma studio
   ```
   to open Prisma Studio, a visual interface for your database, where you can see all your tables and data.

Make sure your `.env` file in the [`backend`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend") directory contains the correct database connection string in the `DATABASE_URL` variable.

If you haven't initialized Prisma in your project yet (which seems unlikely given the context, but just in case), you can do so by running:
```sh
npx prisma init
```
This will create the necessary configuration files, including the `.env` file where you should specify your database connection details.

Refer to the [`prisma.candidate.create()`](backend/src/index.ts) invocation in your `index.ts` file for the context of the error.

rgarciademarina: @workspace ok, now it seems to be working. Now we want to expand the form at AddCandidateForm.jsx to accept the rest of the fields that we can accept in our database at the Candidate table. Expand that form and create all the necessary changes for both the frontend and the backend, so it can receive those changes. Keep in mind that the new fields are option. Also I need to inform the user if he is not entering the Name or the email, because they are mandatory fields.

Here's how you can modify [`AddCandidateForm.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx"):

```jsx
// Import statements remain the same

const AddCandidateForm = () => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: '',
    email: '',
    lastName: '',
    phoneNumber: '',
    address: '',
    education: '',
    workExperience: '',
    resume: null, // Assuming 'cv' is handled as 'resume' in the form
  });
  const [formErrors, setFormErrors] = useState({});

  const handleInputChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setFormData({ ...formData, [name]: value });
  };

  const handleFileChange = (e) => {
    setFormData({ ...formData, resume: e.target.files[0] });
  };

  const validateForm = () => {
    let errors = {};
    if (!formData.name.trim()) errors.name = "Name is required.";
    if (!formData.email.trim()) errors.email = "Email is required.";
    setFormErrors(errors);
    return Object.keys(errors).length === 0;
  };

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (!validateForm()) return;

    const data = new FormData();
    Object.entries(formData).forEach(([key, value]) => {
      if (value !== null) data.append(key, value);
    });

    try {
      const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:3010/api/candidates', data, {
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
        },
      });
      console.log(response.data);
      // Handle success
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      // Handle error
    }
  };

  // Form rendering logic remains the same, add new input fields accordingly
};

export default AddCandidateForm;
```

### Backend Changes

1. **Update the Candidate Model**: Ensure that the `Candidate` model in your `schema.prisma` file includes all the fields you're planning to accept from the form. Based on the provided schema, it seems this step is already covered.

2. **Update the API Endpoint**: In your backend code (likely in a file like `backend/src/routes/candidates.js` or similar), ensure that the endpoint handling the form submission is updated to accept and process the new fields. This involves updating the logic that extracts data from the request and saves it to the database using Prisma.

Example backend endpoint update (assuming Express.js):

```javascript
app.post('/api/candidates', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { name, email, lastName, phoneNumber, address, education, workExperience, resume } = req.body;
    // Assuming 'resume' is handled appropriately, e.g., saving the file and storing its path
    const candidate = await prisma.candidate.create({
      data: {
        firstName: name,
        email,
        lastName,
        phoneNumber,
        address,
        education,
        workExperience,
        cv: resume, // Ensure this is the path to the stored file or similar
      },
    });
    res.json(candidate);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send("An error occurred while processing your request.");
  }
});
```

3. **Validation and Error Handling**: Ensure your backend validates the required fields (`firstName` and [`email`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") in this case) and returns appropriate error messages if validation fails.

These changes will allow your application to accept the additional candidate information through the [`AddCandidateForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FAddCandidateForm.jsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/src/components/AddCandidateForm.jsx") and process it in the backend. Remember to test both the frontend and backend thoroughly to ensure that the data flows correctly and that validation works as expected.

This is happening because in your request handler for `/api/candidates`, you're destructuring the request body and expecting a [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A36%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") field, but when you're passing the data to Prisma, you're not including a [`firstName`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") field which is required according to your Prisma schema.

To fix this issue, you need to map the [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A36%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") field from the request body to the [`firstName`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") field expected by Prisma. Here's how you can adjust the relevant part of your code in [`backend/src/index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/src/index.ts"):

  // Assuming 'resume' is handled appropriately, e.g., saving the file and storing its path
  const candidate = await prisma.candidate.create({
    data: {
      firstName: name, // Map 'name' from the request to 'firstName' expected by Prisma
      email,
      lastName,
      phoneNumber,
      address,
      education,
      workExperience,
      cv: resume, // Ensure this is the path to the stored file or similar
    },
  });
  res.json(candidate);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
  res.status(500).send("An error occurred while processing your request.");
}
```

This change correctly maps the `name` field from the request to the `firstName` field in your Prisma model, which should resolve the `PrismaClientValidationError` you're seeing.

rgarciademarina: @workspace I still have the same issue. As it is causing problems let's update the Candidate table of the database to use name instead of firstName. Please give me the necessary changes and how to apply them

Workspace: To update the `Candidate` table in your database to use [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3375%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts") instead of `firstName`, you'll need to make changes in both your Prisma schema and create a new migration. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. Update Prisma Schema

First, update your Prisma schema file located at [`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fprisma%2Fschema.prisma%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/prisma/schema.prisma"). Replace the `firstName` field with a [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3375%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts") field in the `Candidate` model:

```prisma
model Candidate {
  id             Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name           String   // Updated field
  lastName       String?
  email          String
  phoneNumber    String?
  address        String?
  education      String?
  workExperience String?
  cv             String? // Path to CV file or similar
}
```

### 2. Generate a New Migration

After updating the schema, you need to generate a new migration to reflect these changes in your database. Open your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory, and run the following command:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name update-candidate-name
```

This command does two things:
- It generates a new migration file in your `prisma/migrations` directory that includes the SQL needed to rename the `firstName` column to [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3375%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts") in the `Candidate` table.
- It applies the migration to your database, updating the schema.

### 3. Verify the Changes

After applying the migration, you can verify that the changes have been made successfully by inspecting your database or by using the Prisma Studio:

```sh
npx prisma studio
```

Prisma Studio provides a GUI to view and edit data in your database, making it easier to confirm that the `firstName` column has been renamed to `name`.

### Note

- Ensure you have backed up your database before applying the migration, as schema changes can potentially lead to data loss.
- If you have existing code that references the `firstName` field, you'll need to update it to use `name` instead. This includes any queries, mutations, or any logic that interacts with the `Candidate` model's `firstName` field.

Then run prisma migrate dev to apply it and verify it works.

Workspace: The error you encountered during the migration process with Prisma indicates that you're trying to add a new required column [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A36%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") to the `Candidate` table, but since there are existing rows in the table, Prisma cannot proceed without a default value for the new column. This is because the existing rows would violate the not-null constraint of the new column.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

1. **Provide a default value for the new column**: You can modify the migration SQL file manually to include a default value for the [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A36%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") column. This way, existing rows will have this default value after the migration.

2. **Make the new column optional temporarily**: Another approach is to first add the column as optional (nullable), populate it with appropriate values, and then alter the column to be required (non-nullable).

3. **Use a two-step migration process**:
    - First, create the column as nullable so that the migration can proceed without requiring a default value.
    - Populate the new column with appropriate values for all existing rows.
    - Finally, modify the column to be non-nullable and run another migration.

Here's how you can manually adjust the migration to include a default value (assuming you want to use the first approach):

1. Run `npx prisma migrate dev --create-only --name update-candidate-name`. This will create the migration file without applying it.
2. Open the generated SQL migration file located in [`backend/prisma/migrations/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fprisma%2Fmigrations%2F%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/prisma/migrations/") (it will have a timestamp followed by `update-candidate-name` in its name).
3. Find the line that adds the [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A36%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") column to the `Candidate` table. It will look something like this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "Candidate" ADD COLUMN "name" TEXT NOT NULL;
```

4. Modify it to include a default value. For example, if you want to set the default name as "Unknown", you can change the line to:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "Candidate" ADD COLUMN "name" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Unknown';
```

5. Save the file and then run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply the migration.

Remember, after the migration, you might want to update the rows that have the default value with more appropriate data if possible.

Workspace: The error you're encountering indicates that the `name` field is missing when you're trying to create a new [`candidate`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A38%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") record using Prisma's `create` method. This is happening in the `/api/candidates` endpoint in your [`backend/src/index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/raul/lidr/AI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm/backend/src/index.ts") file.

Based on the error message and the code excerpt you've provided, it seems like you're destructuring the request body to extract fields including `name`, but the error suggests that `name` is not being passed correctly to the [`prisma.candidate.create`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fraul%2Flidr%2FAI4Devs-lab-ides-rgm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/index.ts") method.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the `name` field is correctly included in the request body when you make a request to the `/api/candidates` endpoint. If the `name` field is correctly included in the request body, double-check the destructuring assignment in your endpoint handler to ensure that `name` is being correctly extracted and passed to the `create` method.

Here's the relevant part of your code with a comment highlighting where to check:

```typescript
app.post('/api/candidates', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { name, email, lastName, phoneNumber, address, education, workExperience, resume } = req.body;
    // Ensure 'name' is correctly extracted from req.body and passed here
    const candidate = await prisma.candidate.create({
      data: {
        name, // Check this line
        email,
        lastName,
        phoneNumber,
        address,
        education,
        workExperience,
        cv: resume, // Ensure this is the path to the stored file or similar
      },
    });
    res.json(candidate);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send("An error occurred while processing your request.");
  }
});
```

If the `name` field is indeed being sent in the request and you're still encountering this issue, you might want to log the `req.body` before the destructuring assignment to ensure that the `name` field is present and correctly named.

rgarciademarina: please explain how to do this: "If the name field is indeed being sent in the request and you're still encountering this issue, you might want to log the req.body before the destructuring assignment to ensure that the name field is present and correctly named."

GitHub Copilot: To log the `req.body` before the destructuring assignment to ensure that the `name` field is present and correctly named, you can insert a `console.log` statement right after your endpoint receives the request and before you destructure the `req.body`. This allows you to inspect the entire body of the request to verify that it contains the `name` field as expected.

Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
app.post('/api/candidates', async (req, res) => {
  // Log the entire request body to inspect it
  console.log(req.body);

  try {
    // Destructuring assignment happens after logging req.body
    const { name, email, lastName, phoneNumber, address, education, workExperience, resume } = req.body;

    // The rest of your endpoint logic...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send("An error occurred while processing your request.");
  }
});
```

By adding `console.log(req.body);` right after the endpoint starts processing the request, you can see the entire request body printed out in your console. This way, you can check if the `name` field (and any other expected fields) are present and correctly named before they are destructured and used in your logic. If the `name` field is missing or misspelled in the request body, it will be evident from the logged output, and you can then adjust your frontend code accordingly to ensure the correct data is being sent.
